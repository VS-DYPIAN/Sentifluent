Yet, this is too much information to unload to your reader before the actual story has even begun. Also, there are so many characters. Maybe you could have divided them. In the beginning but the few that are the major ones and then mention all the others. That way your reader will at least remember them and maybe which house they belong to.

(But that’s just me.) I suggest that as you write, you keep track of your world building. Like don’t explain/describe too much at the beginning / first five or so chapters of your story. Make sure to split paragraphs and sentences if necessary. Start with surface and/or most important details and keep them concise because I found that writers usually fall into this trap:  “You’re braver now that Crabbe and Goyle are with you.” Crabbe and Goyle glared at Harry. “I’d take you anytime on my own. Up for a wizard’s duel?” Malfoy drawled. I might’ve learnt that I was a wizard just a month ago, but I wasn’t so ignorant now.
