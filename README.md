**Sentiment Analysis:**
- Used Selenium to scrape user comments on all chapters of my book at https://www.wattpad.com/361651023-crown-of-glass. 
- My aim was to analyse user sentiment towards **different characters** or **specific terms** in the story. 
- I cleaned and preprocessed the data using regex and did sentiment analysis using the vader lexicon from nltk. 
- Finally, I plotted the results using matplotlib to visualise positive, neutral and negative emotions towards each of the different characters by number and percentage of mentions.
