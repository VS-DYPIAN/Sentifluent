A dashboard for viewing character targeted sentiment analysis and story stats.

It uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup for scraping comments + Pandas and NLTK for data preprocessing and sentiment analysis +  Streamlit and Plotly Express for the dashboard and visulization. You can find the deployed website [here!](https://sentifluent.herokuapp.com/) 

---

## Features:

- The `scrape.py` files use Selenium and BeautifulSoup for scraping around 35k comments from over 100 chapters of my work on Wattpad, [here](https://www.wattpad.com/user/rubyruins).
- The `preprocess.py` files clean, preprocess and split the comments into sentiment scores using NLTK's VADER lexicon. VADER relies on a dictionary that maps lexical features to emotion intensities known as sentiment scores. 
- Most computations are performed on the Compound sentiment score. The sentiment score of a text can be obtained by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.
- The `sentiment.py` file creates the dashboard which visualises stats and inferences.

## Tech stack:

- `selenium` and `beautifulsoup:` data mining.
- `pandas:` formatting and cleaning the data.
- `nltk:` sentiment analysis using VADER.
- `plotly express:` visualisations.
- `streamlit:` web framework.

## Deployment:

The live project is deployed on https://sentifluent.herokuapp.com/. 

---

## Local installation:

**You must have Python 3.6 or higher to run the file.**

- Create a new virtual environment for running the application. You can follow the instructions [here.](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/)
- Navigate to the virtual environment and activate it.
- Install the dependancies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the `sentiment.py` file with `streamlit run sentiment.py`

**Note:** to run the scraping and preprocessing scripts locally, you must have a version of `chromedriver.exe` that matches the one installed on your device.
