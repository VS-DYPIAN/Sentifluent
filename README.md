## Day 1: 20th March, 2020
**Fake News Classifier:**
Built a Multinomial Naive Bayes model using a Count Vectorizer (88% accuracy) and a TfIdf Vectorizer (86% accuracy.) Also tried obtaining results with a Passive Aggresive Classifier (87% accuracy.)

## Day 2, 3, 4 and 5: 21st to 24th March, 2020
**Sentiment Analysis:**
Used Selenium to scrape user comments on all chapters of my book at https://www.wattpad.com/361651023-crown-of-glass. My aim was to analyse user sentiment towards different characters in the story. I cleaned and preprocessed the data using regex and did sentiment analysis using the vader lexicon from nltk. Finally, I plotted the results using matplotlib to visualise positive, neutral and negative emotions towards each of the different characters by number and percentage of mentions.
