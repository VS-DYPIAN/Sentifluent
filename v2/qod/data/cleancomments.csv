23,QUEEN OF DEATH,TheAnnoyingBitch,Jul 20 2020,"If I may offer some insight? The Greek tales didn't speak of a 'rape'. In Greek  the title of the myth is ""The taking of Persephone"" (which only refers to the kidnapping). The ""rape of Persephone"" as you know it comes from the Latin versions (Ovid mainly) and the word ""rapere"" which  over the years changed in context and got associated heavily with sexual assault. It is speculated  since Hades followed the marital customs to the letter  that he didn't touch her sexually until after she ate the seeds  as it happened in all marriages that occurred during those years.",0.081,0.919,0.0,-0.8591
24,QUEEN OF DEATH,TheAnnoyingBitch,Jul 20 2020,"Um  I don't know if this is just for your book or if it is what you've read in general but Demeter wasn't ""obsessed"" with Persephone. She was the embodiment of every Greek mother of the times that suffered the loss of her daughter when that daughter got married. During that period  when the daughter got married  she usually moved far away and never saw her mother again. Also  marriage many times equalled a quick death (either from childbirth or an illness) so  it is pretty evident why Demeter chose to protect her daughter. ",0.117,0.808,0.075,-0.6709

Also  poor Zeus. He's almost as disgruntled as Hades is. Now  oh where could Zeus' wifey be?  Nonetheless  I really love this story. It's just the right amount of dark  but lightweight. I would definitely recommend it to my sibling's preteen friends. Just to make them cringe at the romance but absolutely love the drama!

2522,SIX,faywritr,Jan 29 2019,"Even though I dislike the cliche brooding bad boy of darkness  expletives  etc.  I am somehow tolerating Hades. He's not that bad. Also  again  no offence  some of the descriptions -- especially for appearances  like ""immortal lips"" -- are throwing me off the action a little bit  sucking me out of the experience. Feels a bit odd to describe lips as immortal. Despite that  I understand and respect entirely that you're just trying a new style.  ) <3 ",0.203,0.643,0.154,-0.6637

(i ghost-read it all without stopping to vote or comment bc that's how good it was--and then i did a lil voting spree in the end teehee)  everything about this--the character development  the descriptive writing that is literally perfectly in the middle (not too much so it gets boring but not too little)  the plotline  the way you seamlessly tie in greek mythology without making it boring--is beautiful. i have nEver in my reading days come across a male character more entrancing and intriguing and alluring than your Hades  and that's all because of the way you wrote about him !!! ugh i'm just totally infatuated with this story  and i'm on the edge of my seat for it.   so  no matter how annoying this is  would you please update this soon *sobs* it would literally make my entire year.  also  i'm totally sold on the trilogy idea!! stay awesome xx ,0.091,0.761,0.148,0.9451
