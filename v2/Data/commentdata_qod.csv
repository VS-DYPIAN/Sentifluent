QUEEN OF DEATH,TheAnnoyingBitch,Jul 20,This comment may be offensive. If I may offer some insight? The Greek tales didn't speak of a 'rape'. In Greek  the title of the myth is "The taking of Persephone" (which only refers to the kidnapping). The "rape of Persephone" as you know it comes from the Latin versions (Ovid mainly) and the word "rapere" which  over the years changed in context and got associated heavily with sexual assault. It is speculated  since Hades followed the marital customs to the letter  that he didn't touch her sexually until after she ate the seeds  as it happened in all marriages that occurred during those years.
QUEEN OF DEATH,TheAnnoyingBitch,Jul 20,Um, I don't know if this is just for your book or if it is what you've read in general but Demeter wasn't "obsessed" with Persephone. She was the embodiment of every Greek mother of the times that suffered the loss of her daughter when that daughter got married. During that period, when the daughter got married, she usually moved far away and never saw her mother again. Also, marriage many times equalled a quick death (either from childbirth or an illness) so, it is pretty evident why Demeter chose to protect her daughter.
QUEEN OF DEATH,TheAnnoyingBitch,Jul 20,Hades was actually the oldest and Zeus was the youngest, hence why he was the one to free his siblings from Kronos

QUEEN OF DEATH,lvsung,Oct 05, 2019,I honestly feel much more attached to stories where the author really talks to the reader like a friend. I love u too
QUEEN OF DEATH,lufemania,Oct 01, 2019,Personally, I think you are amazing for actually giving a few details about greek mythology for some readers who have no idea what may be happening. Most authors will just dive right into the story without so much as background knowledge on things most don‚Äôt really know. Also I‚Äôm already in love with this because Hades and Persephone are literally my favorite couple.
QUEEN OF DEATH,Abbzreads,Sep 25, 2019,Another fun fact! Persephone is actually a woman of colour.
QUEEN OF DEATH,Abbzreads,Sep 25, 2019,But the one with the pomegranate and stuff isn‚Äôt the original story of Hades and Persephone. The actual one is when Persephone is named Kore and she finds an entersnce tp the underworld and likes it so she wants to stay there then when Hades sees her he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat is beautiful woman doing here?‚Äù And stuff.
QUEEN OF DEATH,Abbzreads,Sep 25, 2019,Hades isn‚Äôt the god of the dead though, he‚Äôs the lord of the dead and the god of riches.
QUEEN OF DEATH,Abbzreads,Sep 25, 2019,Fun fact, Hades isn‚Äôt the god of death. He‚Äôs the god of riches and the lord of the underworld. Actually Thanatos who‚Äôs the angel of death.

You simply have a penchant for writing characters I need In my friend group :D  Also  Zeus is something else entirely. Thank you for actually making him a Dad! Most of the myths I've read portray him as a heartless f-boy. I'm totally stocked to see how this union will turn out. Amazing chapter  honey!

PROLOGUE,theophorous,Mar 31, 2019,I‚Äôve always been a bit finicky when it came to Greek Mythology, though the stories themselves are fascinating, modern retelling had a habit of doing them a great injustice that put me off them for awhile. This, however, is a twist I‚Äôd never expected. Persephone has always been either treated as a naive victim of unfortunate circumstances, or a woman with a darker inclination that her fair eyes and wide eyes would suggest. I‚Äôm curious to see of the route you take her character development and disposition. Also Aphrodite reminds me of that one Aunt your mother wishes you never end up as but you idolize anyway because she‚Äôs an iconic queen

PROLOGUE,_loverose,Aug 23, 2018,I sense the overprotectiveness
PROLOGUE,dxriangray,Aug 18, 2018,the portrayal of all of the gods in this part is so damn accurate lol
PROLOGUE,midastouch-,Aug 18, 2018,Cant you just go to Ares, though?

PROLOGUE,Addie_Belle,Jul 26, 2018,ooh I like this ending
PROLOGUE,Addie_Belle,Jul 26, 2018,Your imagery is really fitting for this genre, and I'd like to see more. I also like that the respective powers of the gods are reflective of their emotions.
PROLOGUE,Addie_Belle,Jul 26, 2018,Okay, so mythology is always interesting and there's definitely an audience for it, but you're definitely relying heavily on people's prior knowledge of mythology(or that they'll research it.) There's no introduction of the scene at all. The writing is great, but I thought it I'd point out how niche this is.
PROLOGUE,Moonlight_Rose9,Jul 25, 2018,Magnificently on point. This was so interesting

PROLOGUE,riyamcyriac,Jul 07, 2018,Aphrodite is such a facinating character. She's so diabolical and unloving for the godess of love. She looks like she'd be great to read and TBH I binge read all of this yesterday but you said not to complete payment until you accepted it sooo this is amazing.

ONE,theophorous,Mar 31, 2019,The fact that Zeus, essentially, sold his daughter and while simultaneously abusing his power as King of Gods to gain the consent of his brother speaks loads of his character. Men like him are like dogs, all bark and territorial until they find themselves at the mercy of a pretty girl with a sharp mind and even sharper teeth.

Don't get me wrong  I LOVE the narration and dialogue  but often I feel like it's not Zeus who is telling the story  but his soul rotating around the setting of the story telling of what Zeus's body is doing. (Does that make sense?) But  again  it's entirely up to you to take this suggestion. ‚ù§

ONE,_loverose,Aug 24, 2018,I loved this chapter! Seeing Zeus and his interactions with Hades added alot of tension and life to your writing. Also I love how you've made Hades witty and sarcastic whilst shrouding his physical appearance in mystery. I can't wait to read on! :)
ONE,_loverose,Aug 24, 2018,Ahhh this phrase adds so much character to Zeus

You've got great writing skills, but I'd like to see how your story differs from others in this genre.
ONE,Addie_Belle,Jul 26, 2018,They're dialogue is charming. I like how they still have the playfulness of siblings as gods.

ONE,0riginalQueen,Jul 10, 2018,I like it that you kept the identity of Hades a mystery, everyone is kind of painting their own picture right now in their mind of how Hades will look like. I kind of don't like how every few sentences you have a new paragraph,  but I think that was only because of how much  speaking was going on in this chapter. Then again this is your story not mine.
ONE,BooksOfAnyKind,Jul 10, 2018,Most retellings give more emotional reasons for Hades to wed Persephone, not political ones. :)

THREE,Kiahni_C,Feb 17, 2019,I love this subtle hint of her being drawn to death, even though I don't know the myth very well, I know enough to adore this foreshadowing.
THREE,Kiahni_C,Feb 17, 2019,Oof your chapters always start with a stunning visual that I just want to paint on my walls and remember the feeling it gave me that first time I read it and imagined it.

THREE,faywritr,Jan 29, 2019,Whoa  girl. Snap!   Also  the things she described basically hints to darkness. Is that why she'll fall for Hades?

THREE,iloojin,Jan 13, 2019,I like your story, but sometimes I also dislike it as I have a hard time remember each name and powers but also tell myself that they are not the same people as in your other book. But it's fine, I apologise for not having a good memory.

THREE,-POINTBREAK-,Aug 02, 2018,‚ÄúCrafted out of pretty lies and golden hands‚Äù this line has me shook
THREE,Addie_Belle,Jul 26, 2018,I'm excited to see how her love for her mom and her attraction to Hades affects her. This I think was my favorite chapter yet!
THREE,Addie_Belle,Jul 26, 2018,it'd be neat if you described how she said this
THREE,Addie_Belle,Jul 26, 2018,This is good, but it feels rushed. This fight defiantly needs to build a little more. We've heard a lot about the relationship she has with their mom, but the readers aren't that attach to her enough for this to be as impact full as it should. I'm really excited to see who this character becomes, though!
THREE,Addie_Belle,Jul 26, 2018,I got the POV i wanted! I'm really hoping she's a badass tbh especially if she's going to tame Hades.

THREE,VanillaCoca,Jul 18, 2018,I‚Äôve never read anything with Persephone before but she‚Äôs actually quite an awesome character
THREE,16wolfheart16,Jul 17, 2018,I love the way you portray Persephone, all bruised knuckles, and chaos like you said. I can't wait to see what'll happen when she meets Hades.
THREE,xoxo_celeste,Jul 17, 2018,Ooh, a new version of Persephone that isn‚Äôt all sunshine and flowers! A great breath of fresh air, if you ask me.

THREE,MoonyChris,Jul 04, 2018,Loved the chapter! I can‚Äôt wait to see what Demeter and Persephone look like! I think that Persephone will leave. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm right  but I think she will leave. And don‚Äôt forget...   Hades + Persephone   =  Hersephone
THREE,MoonyChris,Jul 04, 2018,Persephone because Demeter sometimes acts likes ( Excuse my language ) she has a stick up her booty and wants everything to be perfect.
THREE,MoonyChris,Jul 04, 2018,. . . Will she leave? O.o

THREE,-ater-,Feb 09, 2018,*Swooning* This is the most beautiful line I've heard in this book
THREE,-ater-,Feb 09, 2018,She's not meant for life  nor to breathe life. She's not meant to be in the meadow  full of vibrant hues.  She's meant for death  to be his Queen  his Lover. She's made to kill  to destroy life. To feel the last trickle of life leaving. She's meant to be with him  in a palace  filled with gold and diamonds; the smell of death  misery and sadness  like a perfume  clinging onto their souls. She's made to rule with her king. For Death is A Lover  who lives for her.

Also  poor Zeus. He's almost as disgruntled as Hades is. Now  oh where could Zeus' wifey be?  Nonetheless  I really love this story. It's just the right amount of dark  but lightweight. I would definitely recommend it to my sibling's preteen friends. Just to make them cringe at the romance but absolutely love the drama! Once again  another amazing -- though slow paced -- chapter!

FOUR,riyamcyriac,Jul 07, 2018,I think Hades is hilarious in this chapter. "I don't think you know how the underworld works, brother." A d wow I didn't expect Aphrodite's to KILL lovers but she is a nutjib. I still love her she gets what she wants. I don't know why Zeus cares much about Persephone because he has like a million kids but works with me.
FOUR,beautyinadrop,Jul 06, 2018,I just thought of something, because hades is zues' brother, and persephone is zues' daughter, doesnt that mean hades is persephone's uncle?

FIVE,diredragons,Jul 19, 2018,Hades boo, that better be you. Swoop in and save the day. I could almost feel Persephone‚Äôs fright in this, and I like that this was brought up because so many young men have a hard time understanding the concept of the word no because it‚Äôs like a bruise to their ego.

SIX,theophorous,Apr 20, 2019,Parts of me are torn between a sense of relief for what‚Äôs he‚Äôs done for her, and apprehension on what he wants to do with her; they treat her like a commodity, something to own or batter with or control; Hades senses there is more substance to her, something sharper and meaner and with teeth behind the lace and silk ‚Äî but like the others, he wants to cover her like she‚Äôs something to be owned. I hope she proves him wrong

SIX,faywritr,Jan 29, 2019,Even though I dislike the cliche brooding bad boy of darkness, expletives, etc., I am somehow tolerating Hades. He's not that bad. Also, again, no offence, some of the descriptions -- especially for appearances, like "immortal lips" -- are throwing me off the action a little bit, sucking me out of the experience.

NINE,theophorous,Apr 20, 2019,I feel for Demeter ‚Äî in a way, in some sense; she wants to protect her daughter, and loves her, but her mannerism has been warped; it seems that there is nothing she would do to have her daughter back, which shouldn‚Äôt be troubling if she wasn‚Äôt behaving any different from the other olympians. They continue to treat Persephone like something to be sought after; has anyone even taking the time to consider what her thoughts and feelings were in this whole mess? Probably not

My hats off to you  author  I love this story.  I love that the Fates are included  that Persephone is not a demure simple goddess of Spring  that she too has her own darkness.  I. LOVE. IT.

TWELVE,botceribot101,Mar 28,Hades was never described to be this ahhdhd degratting to persophone. Wasn't he supposed to be gentle ND loving with her ? What is this fuckery
TWELVE,botceribot101,Mar 28,This comment may be offensive. Fuck off
TWELVE,celestialmoon808,Mar 09,I like how Zeus is trying to get Persephone to understand why she is being married off. Of course, there are so many different versions of this myth within the Greek Mythos, but I like this twist on it, that it truly is for her safety and sanity. That she will be able to live a life, which will be much more free than her life with her mother, despite still being trapped.
TWELVE,RunningFromReality11,Jan 26,Why doesn‚Äôt the earth swallow me up and take me to the underworld too????
TWELVE,Naverliam,Jan 13,I thought her name was originally Kore untill she married Hades and then Zeus gave her the name persephone?
TWELVE,SerwahNTIM,Nov 18, 2019,This comment may be offensive. 'I'm a bad bitch  you can't kill me'üòÇ

TWELVE,DaisyMae19,Aug 25, 2019,Oh Lord
TWELVE,burgundoise,Aug 03, 2019,How dare Hades make my baby girl feel like that! This chapter was amazing, though. I could feel the wedding hall, the guest's emotions, the tension, like I was right there. You have such a knack for writing dramatic scenes. I kind of want Persephone to overthrow Hades instead of falling for him. Just because? üòÇ
TWELVE,moonandstarsishy,Jul 24, 2019,Ooooh
TWELVE,moonandstarsishy,Jul 24, 2019,Oooooh

TWELVE,halimalfoy,May 02, 2018,i annoy myself with how i keep procrastinating to read crown of glass
TWELVE,wraithed,Apr 03, 2018,This comment may be offensive. every problem in Greek mythology could be summed up with; "zeus tried to f√πck something  and then everything went to shit."
TWELVE,wraithed,Apr 03, 2018,zeus doesn't know how to keep his wiener in his pants
TWELVE,sarcasticbitchQueen,Mar 29, 2018,Yeah keep her away from Zeusy boy as well. As soon as she hits-who am I kidding! Zeus already impregnated her in the original myth! The struggles of being a Greek mythology nerd...
TWELVE,sarcasticbitchQueen,Mar 29, 2018,Or in shorter terms. Zeus couldn't keep it in his pants for half a second before having a kid with his sister, cousins, neices, random women and his own daughters (I would not recommend researching that one!)

THIRTEEN,ayeayeron_,Jul 01, 2019,Sometimes I wonder why they be marrying relatives and then I remember gods don‚Äôt have dna so it has no effect on how their children turn out so it doesn‚Äôt matter

THIRTEEN,queenlythefirst,Jun 09, 2019,well  I mean  you are technically her uncle and her dad (your brother) did technically force her to marry you cause your niece/aunt/cousin threw a hissy fit.   I think it's safe to say that explains a lot.

THIRTEEN,-ater-,Jun 09, 2019,as much as I want to drag Demeter to the underworld by her hair and torture her myself, you can't blame her. Persephone's the only thing she's got.

FOURTEEN,GhostWriterGirl-1,Jun 19, 2019,Yes, even though you were born to rule, Persephone
FOURTEEN,GhostWriterGirl-1,Jun 19, 2019,Probably freak out that her ‚Äúprecious flower‚Äù is with the ‚Äúbig, bad, scary‚Äù god of the Underworld and is the Underworld‚Äôs new queen

FIFTEEN,LadyThomoson,Oct 12, 2019,Now, now Demeter, play nicely.
FIFTEEN,gallivanters,Sep 26, 2019,It's actually sad, there's versions that say Zeus tricked or forced himself on Demeter and the result was Persephone. That's probably why she was so protective over her
FIFTEEN,PRIVGUK,Sep 15, 2019,uh no hades rescued her from getting raped by Hermes and Apollo
FIFTEEN,burgundoise,Aug 03, 2019,Okay momma bear -- I see you üëÄ  So can I just say your descriptions throw me of the edge. You truly are Wattpad's Queen of Descriptions. An amazing chapter  as always!

FIFTEEN,moonandstarsishy,Jul 24, 2019,Yep
FIFTEEN,Poison117,Jul 19, 2019,Oh. Just wait until she finds out what Zeus did. Can't wait to see her reaction.
FIFTEEN,reverielles,Jul 17, 2019,She isn‚Äôt your property, dear. Address the QUEEN with respect
FIFTEEN,eyeamwatchingyou,Jul 08, 2019,"AgAInsT hER WilL."  Oh yeah  sure  Demeter. It's not like you caged her in that stupid home all of her life until Hades came and made her so indoctrinated to only listen to and believe you or anything. I mean  of course not  since you're SUCH A WONDERFUL MOTHER!
FIFTEEN,SkylerDeceo,Jul 07, 2019,great idea
FIFTEEN,queenlythefirst,Jul 06, 2019,this is the kindest possibly way to tell someone they've gotta go so you can just sleep goddamnit woman do you think I don't have bags under my eyes for nothing
FIFTEEN,queenlythefirst,Jul 06, 2019,I imagine Lena Headey as Demeter. So throughout this whole chapter it was like Cersei was having on of her rants inside my head

FIFTEEN,ray_xo,Jul 05, 2019,Yeah, papi.
FIFTEEN,GhostWriterGirl-1,Jul 05, 2019,God  Demeter is like a combination of Mother Gothel from Tangled and the Other Mother from Coraline... only worse!  Also  can‚Äôt wait for more Greek drama and to see more of Hades and Persephone!
FIFTEEN,GhostWriterGirl-1,Jul 05, 2019,Uh, excuse me, Demeter! For one, Hades RESCUED Persephone from being taken advantage of Hermes and Apollo! For two, he did NOT take her against her will when he had the chance after they married, so therefore he DIDN‚ÄôT defile her. And last, he OFFERED that she would stay in the Underworld for a month, and then decide if she wants to leave! So therefore, you are wrong about Hades, Demeter!
FIFTEEN,GhostWriterGirl-1,Jul 05, 2019,O...Kay, then?
FIFTEEN,GhostWriterGirl-1,Jul 05, 2019,Helios, I‚Äôm pretty sure Hades would give even himself to Persephone
FIFTEEN,GhostWriterGirl-1,Jul 05, 2019,Yes, indeed Hades
FIFTEEN,GhostWriterGirl-1,Jul 05, 2019,Against her will? Demeter, YOU‚ÄôRE the one who‚Äôs basically kept her trapped all her entire life!

EIGHTEEN,zuzypiia,Oct 17,idk actually‚Äî people in mycenaean greece  an age before the actual ancient greek  would actually worship chthonic gods; gods with strong connections to the underworld. so i think back then people would actually worship hades more. it's probably out of fear  but maybe it's also because they thought it was cool? idk tho lol  that's from what I've gathered--
EIGHTEEN,zuzypiia,Oct 17,lol even better, the underworld is like a community similar to olympus, but unlike olympus everyone's chill with each other lol
EIGHTEEN,zuzypiia,Oct 17,scientifically  if you have clear waters then you would not see the deepness  you'd actually see that the waters are pretty shallow. just throwing a fact here lol XD so does it look like  an ocean abyss / trench of some sort?

NINETEEN,ephemeralmoments,Aug 26, 2019,whenever I read a HadesxPesephone story, this is always a part of it. But I don't understand why a goddess wouldn't know that Hades doesn't decide who dies or not. Like okay, I understand that normal people wouldn't know the detailed workings of Olympus and the underworld but I find it very difficult to swallow that gods and goddesses wouldn't know about how the Fates work and that they are not influenced by anyone. This is not criticism for the book (I love it and it's beautifully written), I'm just confused

TWENTY EIGHT,Liya_vw,Sep 14,Okay so I get that you want to take back every ounce of freedom that you were supposed to have but I need you to think, like actually think, before you go into Tartarus. It is literally a place where they torture you and you just walked right in. I don't need you to be this ignorant about the dangers that lerk around in Tartarus, you need to start understanding that Hedes is not trying to control you but only trying to keep you safe. I know about being locked away from the world and everything in it, I know how it feels, feeling so helpless, feeling suffocated and feeling like you're being held captive but you have to know that not everyone is trying to control you...

TWENTY EIGHT,Blonde_Moments101,Apr 30,Babe. There is a difference between listening to others because you are dependent on them, and listening to them because they have more experience and are trying to keep you safe. They even explained to you why it's a bad idea for you to not go there, you are just being childish by ignoring them.

A part of me knows that Demeter won't believe in her happiness and will think that Hades has done something to her daughter and drama will happen.  On another note  I can see Persephone slowly getting character development  or is that Justin my head? Anyways good work as usual Author!

(i ghost-read it all without stopping to vote or comment bc that's how good it was--and then i did a lil voting spree in the end teehee)  everything about this--the character development  the descriptive writing that is literally perfectly in the middle (not too much so it gets boring but not too little)  the plotline  the way you seamlessly tie in greek mythology without making it boring--is beautiful. i have nEver in my reading days come across a male character more entrancing and intriguing and alluring than your Hades  and that's all because of the way you wrote about him !!! ugh i'm just totally infatuated with this story  and i'm on the edge of my seat for it.   so  no matter how annoying this is  would you please update this soon *sobs* it would literally make my entire year.  also  i'm totally sold on the trilogy idea!! stay awesome xx
