ACT 0 | ORPHIC,Jamie-Michelle,"Aug 16, 2018","Hiya!  I'm a big reader of high fantasy and some of the inspirations you listed for this story are some of my favorite books so I thought to check this out! Being honest, I really like the lore you've established here (just ask my friends, I'm a sucker for mythology!) And from reading this, it really shows that you've put alot into this world and how all these gods, goddesses and Houses fit into it all. You also really used text alignment to your advantage and I think it really fit the tone you were trying to convey. However, I have to say while the writing itself was fine, the overall feel of this opening felt...clunky.   ""This is the story Queen who no longer feared death..of a King who helped her laugh again...."" (I'm paraphrasing here, please bear with me.)  It's alot of telling versus showing and then you have a huge shift in tone. Almost like you went from pitching the story to the readers to going to some scene where X character is hearing stories around a campfire. It's a pretty sharp contrast and it doesn't go very well together in my opinion. I think you'd really benefit from getting rid of ""This is the story of a queen"" bit and just leaving this prologue as the conversation between the unknown characters about the world and the gods and goddesses who inhabit it.  So overall, I'm not super sold on this prolouge as it is, but your lore is so detailed that I think I'm going to move on and see what happens next.   Write on! :)",1 Reply

Second, the proologues are typically the boring part of the story but this one stole my heart in a million ways. The characters seem unique and awesome and I can't wait for them to develop into the likeable heroes or villains they will become later on in the future.

How you shaped the conversations into a powerful telling of the history of the whole planets. It was so new seeing prologues like this. Where everything is cleared up in such a simple yet informative way. If you had wrote this history in the form of paragraphs and telling it would've been too much information and too heavy for a prologue. But, this was very clever.  I so enjoyed the story behind their replies. It was very interesting, very intriguing. And I couldn't help but feel eager.   The ending too was so powerful, holding strong meanings behind it and I love these kind of cliffhangers.  Well done!",1 Reply

It's definitely going somewhere because this is not only super creative, but I love how this is written. It doesn't get boring like many other books usually do.

ACT 0 | ORPHIC,-,"Jul 25, 2017"," #believerbc  Let me just say, I am in awe. I can tell how much plotting, thinking, and connecting you had to do to create this world. Fantasy is one of the hardest genre's to write because you have to create an entirely new world with entirely different customs, mannerisms, people, animals, and ecosystem, but I feel you are nailing it. This is just my personal opinion, but i think it might be more organic if you didn't pose this as like an extra, history of the world kind of thing. I think some people might chalk it up to be something that's optional and jump into the next chapter, but I'm guessing this will be important info later. I know you already have a prologue,  which means you can't have another, but I would like to suggest, that you make this a chapter, rather than an informational little tidbit before the book. The writing is already in sort of a cinematic style, so you could always make it into this omnipotent narrator and remove the first sentence. Take it or leave it. This is just something I wanted to point out. Otherwise, everything is great. I love the voice of your writing.",4 Replies
