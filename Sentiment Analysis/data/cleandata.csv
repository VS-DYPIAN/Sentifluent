Even though you said you didn't take too much inspiration from the Greek Gods I can't help feel a reference to them. Like the warlord of the sea and salt (Neptune) and a God that lives under the bodies of the dead (Hades).  It's a very interesting first look at the book. I do sense youndo have a skill with poetry as well. You've got me hooked.

You were very descriptive with some of the gods  and because of that the reader is able to get a picture of the world they are in and the personality of the gods. I'm getting a Greek god vibe  but it's possible you have different gods in mind. I tend to think the chapter was a little short and I was disappointed there was so little.

Your optic decorations add a nice touch to it as well. The only thing I MIGHT add if I could find anything that matched  would be music.

CROWN OF GLASS,ithinkofrauhl,"Jul 22 2017", #believerbc   Such a good start!! You pulled everyone's ettention with the first line. The way you described each of the gods was geat. This made me curious. Great work. This will keep me glued!!                                                 
CROWN OF GLASS,aquaria13,"Jul 22 2017"," #believerbc I love this. I don't quite know if this counts to comment here but I am anyhow. I love how you go down the line  creating this  sense of suspense and mystery. Usually  in books that have a repeating factor to it such as this introduction type thing  it can get boring. But this had me glued I loved this. Keep up the good work :)"

CROWN OF GLASS,rubyruins,"Jul 12 2017","Thanks :) this one's not exactly the prologue  but it comes in a few chapters. Yep  the main reason was to create a sense of foreboding here  coz towards the ending  things get quite heated up with references to earlier things.  Sure  I guess I'll make the changes with 'Era.' Thanks for pointing out  and most importantly  thanks for reading! Love ya :D"                                                 
CROWN OF GLASS,cdsheridan,"Jul 12 2017","Oooooo chilling. Prologues can sometimes be wearisome  but you've managed to create this awesome sense of foreboding. I love the descriptions of each of the gods  and the fact that you've put it in the present tense. My one callout would be the capitalization of ""Era"" in the last paragraph ‚Äî if it's not a proper noun in the rest of the story to come  I don't think it needs to be capitalized here. But aside from that  yesyesyes! Can't wait to read more!"

Good news  I haven't spotted any grammar/spelling mistakes so far.   Absolutely beautiful descriptions  wonderful vocabulary. It was so powerful and enchants readers right away. The repetition of ""how do you kill a god?"" Set an eerie dynamic too. Also  I like the banner at the top - did you make it?  Excellent start!"

AESTHETICS,JustBEfreEtoLivE,"Aug 05 2017"," #believerbc this chapter showed the dedication you put on making your story and all the planning you have put in it. Yet  this is too much information to unload to your reader before the actual story has even begun. Also  there are so many characters. Maybe you could have divided them. In the beginning but the few that are the major ones and then mention all the others. That way your reader will at least remember them and maybe which house they belong to. As it is I can bearly remember a name and I have literally just read them"

Like other people have said  those pictures are really good.

(But that's just me.) I suggest that as you write  you keep track of your world building. Like don't explain/describe too much at the beginning / first five or so chapters of your story. Make sure to split paragraphs and sentences if necessary. Start with surface and/or most important details and keep them concise because I found that writers usually fall into this trap:  "You're braver now that Crabbe and Goyle are with you." Crabbe and Goyle glared at Harry. "I'd take you anytime on my own. Up for a wizard's duel?" Malfoy drawled. I might've learnt that I was a wizard just a month ago  but I wasn't so ignorant now. A wizard's duel is when blah blah blah really long description here"

ACT 0 | ORPHIC,Jamie-Michelle,"Aug 16 2018","Hiya!  I'm a big reader of high fantasy and some of the inspirations you listed for this story are some of my favorite books so I thought to check this out! Being honest  I really like the lore you've established here (just ask my friends  I'm a sucker for mythology!) And from reading this  it really shows that you've put alot into this world and how all these gods  goddesses and Houses fit into it all. You also really used text alignment to your advantage and I think it really fit the tone you were trying to convey. However  I have to say while the writing itself was fine  the overall feel of this opening felt...clunky.   ""This is the story Queen who no longer feared death..of a King who helped her laugh again...."" (I'm paraphrasing here  please bear with me.)  It's alot of telling versus showing and then you have a huge shift in tone. Almost like you went from pitching the story to the readers to going to some scene where X character is hearing stories around a campfire. It's a pretty sharp contrast and it doesn't go very well together in my opinion. I think you'd really benefit from getting rid of ""This is the story of a queen"" bit and just leaving this prologue as the conversation between the unknown characters about the world and the gods and goddesses who inhabit it.  So overall  I'm not super sold on this prolouge as it is  but your lore is so detailed that I think I'm going to move on and see what happens next.   Write on! :)"

ACT 0 | ORPHIC,-,"Oct 31 2017"," #BGBC Wow  there is so many amazing things I want to say about this masterpiece that words continue to pile on and on as I fight for the right way to say. First of all  I love how your loved ones  specifically your mom inspired you to write. That is like the sweetest thing I've ever heard of. Second  the proologues are typically the boring part of the story but this one stole my heart in a million ways.

ACT 0 | ORPHIC,6dream,"Jul 28 2017"," #BelieverBC   This was one of the best prologue I.ve ever read in my entire life. How you shaped the conversations into a powerful telling of the history of the whole planets. It was so new seeing prologues like this. Where everything is cleared up in such a simple yet informative way. If you had wrote this history in the form of paragraphs and telling it would've been too much information and too heavy for a prologue. But  this was very clever.  I so enjoyed the story behind their replies. It was very interesting  very intriguing. And I couldn't help but feel eager.   The ending too was so powerful  holding strong meanings behind it and I love these kind of cliffhangers.  Well done!"

It's definitely going somewhere because this is not only super creative  but I love how this is written. It doesn't get boring like many other books usually do.

ACT 0 | ORPHIC,-,"Jul 25 2017"," #believerbc  Let me just say  I am in awe. I can tell how much plotting  thinking  and connecting you had to do to create this world. Fantasy is one of the hardest genre's to write because you have to create an entirely new world with entirely different customs  mannerisms  people  animals  and ecosystem  but I feel you are nailing it. This is just my personal opinion  but i think it might be more organic if you didn't pose this as like an extra  history of the world kind of thing. I think some people might chalk it up to be something that's optional and jump into the next chapter  but I'm guessing this will be important info later. I know you already have a prologue   which means you can't have another  but I would like to suggest  that you make this a chapter  rather than an informational little tidbit before the book. The writing is already in sort of a cinematic style  so you could always make it into this omnipotent narrator and remove the first sentence. Take it or leave it. This is just something I wanted to point out. Otherwise  everything is great. I love the voice of your writing."

0 | PROLOGUE,theophorous,May-01 2019,Well then I'm not quite sure what to make of this story yet ‚Äî I won't base my decision solely on the prologue or introductory aesthetics but I'm curious to say the least. She is  or at the very least mildly willing to face the consequences of doing what she should not to gain a leverage she otherwise wouldn't have; which's begs the question of whether it is greed or pride that drives her.

Since I'm farther into the book  I can really see the layers of foreshadowing that you've woven here (no spoilers) and I can once again confirm that COG is my favorite.

0 | PROLOGUE,celestia-starlight,Aug-20 2018,This comment may be offensive. Shittttt is this Celestina? I'd always thought it was Drusilla  but now that I'm rereading and actually know who belongs to which house.... Drusilla is an Everly  not a Rotavelle.  But Celestina said she didn't want the crown?? (Wait  but then what the fuck was her purpose for hurting Edwina???)  Ok  just here to say I love the way you weave mystery so easily into your story. It's intense and everything  yet it never fails to surprise. The characters all have their own hidden... "personalities"  I'd say. It's all executed very cleanly  too.                                          
0 | PROLOGUE,cometworks,Aug-19 2018,i love the intensity of this‚Äîthe way she's always aware of the footsteps coming closer and how her composure starts to crumble hen she finds out her wish cant be granted. this has me hooked & wondering what'll happen next!!!

0 | PROLOGUE,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,I like this chapter a lot more than I liked the prolouge. The overall tone of this chapter was way more consistent and read a lot more smoothly as a result. I really liked the eerie atmosphere you created with the blood ritual; it definitely felt taboo and creepy (and I say that in the best way possible!) And though I don't know the name of this character who was narrating  whoever she was  I think she was established very well. Her tone struck me as very petulant  wanting something she wasn't fit to have and insisting she was owed it  even after she had been denied because some things just can't happen.  I'm definitely getting the idea that she might become a villain in this story after this failed encounter with the shade and the denied wish.   That aside however  I do have a note regarding the writing of this chapter. At times " your prose became a bit too purple (another way to say it got overly descriptive) and really took away from what this could've been.  I saw this most at the opening here:  ""The clock struck twelve"  the planets shifted " the stars exchanged...my blue eyes were hazy..."" Your word choice for this section was nicely varied and certainly descriptive" " but it was a lot of description in a really short amount of time. I think cutting some of it out would help focus on the chapter on the main event (the interaction with the shade) alot more and really throw the reader in head first.  For example: ""The clock struck twelve and I watched as wisps of coal black smoke curled around my hands as the knives slit my wrists. Blood splattered onto the mirror in front of me" " the candles began to dim as I counted back from thirteen....""  I'd hope you'd have better word choice than I did in the above"  but I hope my point comes across either way. We're getting right into the ritual then  rather than taking our time.  Also  last thing  at the end you have single sentences as full paragraphs " ""This was not supposed to happen"  I had to run " the corridor was empty..."""                                
0 | PROLOGUE,tamtam778,Aug-16 2018,That's why shouldn't wish  what you asked for

Your writing style is GORGEOUS and  although I prefer to read Fantasy in 3rd person  you also write perfect in 1st person! Your descriptions are really really well  and for me  a person who does not speak English as her mother tonque  I could understand everything perfect. This chapter is like the perfect balance between mysterieus and thrilling!   And by the way  I absolutely adore your banners!

0 | PROLOGUE,The-Betrayed,Apr-11 2018, #OnlyVoraciousReader  Wonderful!  Superb!  The ending hook was done nicely and will keep the readers hooked and waiting for the next chapter.  It's a very well-written chapter  with good characterization. You have perfected the trick of writing chapters by writing well-sized chapters as most of the wattpaders are usually scrolling on their phones.   They prefer short chapters of 1500-2000 words.   Keep it short and sweet.   Well written.   Your description was well done and it makes the reader feel like he is actually experiencing the story.   Usually  authors choke the readers with too much information  but you are writing perfectly and giving the info gradually.   Excellent opener  though. Very hooking. A well-written chapter  with good characterization  I did not spot any grammar mistakes  but in case I did not spot them  I would recommend using a grammar-checker like Grammarly to smooth out the wrinkles.   It is a good thing that you did not use a lot of A/N in the first chapter  it deters people off from the topic. You have used the Ch1 well  most people misuse the Ch1 or simply do not know how to use it well. they give too much or too less info in one stroke.   I liked the way you end the chapter  it leaves the reader hungry for more.  Thank You.  Regards  OnlyVoraciousReader

0 | PROLOGUE,Pennywithaney,Oct-09 2017,Ever wondered? YES! I have no idea who she is  though. And as to why  people will do strange things for their ambitions. Given the right person  in the right circumstances  some people will do anything for their wishes.   My question is whether there's a deeper reason though. Does she want it for power? For revenge? Because of some unknown conflict that we've yet to see? Perhaps all of the above?   But regardless  I can't wait to continue on reading. Your writing is beautiful (grammatically flawless  descriptive  enthralling) and I can't wait to see how this story unfolds!

0 | PROLOGUE,gcgonzalez,Oct-08 2017,I guess that she is part of the slow burn ship and she did the unlawful blood ritual because the man she loves probably is going to marry someone and she thought it was her  but it wasn't because he does not love her. So this girl decides to do the blood ritual to make the king fall in love with her and make her Queen Ragnant. However  magic cannot make anyone fall in love so it is impossible for her to use this method.

0 | PROLOGUE,thelittlewreck,Aug-28 2017, #BelieverBC   Very captivating prologue! I like how you build up the tension toward the ending of the chapter!  It's cool that you didn't tell who the MC of this chapter was  it makes the reader to want to read more.  And who was the giant woman at the end???!! Is she one of the gods? Is she going to fullfill her reguest to become Queen reagant?

0 | PROLOGUE,ReneeShantel,Aug-20 2017,Even reading everything that came before this prologue  I can tell that you've put a lot of heart and soul into this novel. I'm already awed by it  and it has me excited. Something with this much dedication can't be anything but amazing.   And if the prologue is anything to go by  the story IS going to be amazing. I'm already intrigued.                                              
0 | PROLOGUE,Natashawallflower,Aug-17 2017, #believerbc  This story has me invested. The amount of suspense is perfect  it's enough to keep me turning the page and staying up till 3 to finish the book. The name of the character hasn't been introduced yet  but I'm a patient person so I may as well wait for it. I love how you've provided the backstory to everything. Your diction  and the flow of your writing has me drowning. The start was perfect. The end was perfect.   I noticed one mistake  but it's already been pointed out so no worries :)  I am so grateful I have been given this book read. I'm gonna move forward now.

0 | PROLOGUE,Spark187,Aug-13 2017,This was an intense chapter. The blood ritual was creepy  but also beware of what you wish for because you might get it.  The end was a bit of a cliffhanger. It's a nice hook to get people reading more.

The idea I pretty good  the writing is mysterious which makes you want to know what happens next. Absolutely loved it. The mood  descriptions. I also really liked the way you started the book  how in the story you start it with the mystery  which makes a reader want to read more an more! Well done!

0 | PROLOGUE,-,Aug-06 2017, #believerbc This was an incredibly interesting chapter! It throws the reader straight into the story and in the middle of something very important. I think there was a lack of information  and I had trouble following some of what was going on. I'm guessing that information was in the chapters before this  but it might be better if you found a way to melt the information into the story. I personally found all of those chapters before this a turnoff  minus the first one I commented on.   This chapter was very descriptive and well written. You have an interesting writing style and I want to read more to find out what happens. I do wish this chapter was a little longer  but that's okay. I haven't found any dire grammar mistakes or anything else that needs to be seriously fixed. Good job!

0 | PROLOGUE,JasmanianDevil27,Jul-31 2017," #Leisurely The two ""candle''s are too close to each other. I'd suggest changing the last one to light. Also"  the first period should be a comma unless you want a dramatic pause; however to me it sounds odd.  I hate to ask you to change the wording after the compliment you got on it " but I also like it better as ""candlelight" " seeming hazy.""  So as a whole with all changes included"  it would be:  My eyes were blue in the candlelight  seeming hazy.

0 | PROLOGUE,6dream,Jul-28 2017, #BelieverBC  Another beautiful prologue. But  am quite confused. If this is a prologue  then what is the other one?  Anyway  this was beautifully developed. You described the scene progressively and with great details. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen just like when watching a powerful scene in movies. I enjoyed the mystery  the anger  the suspense as I read this chapter. Your writing style is one to attract. You know how to keep your readers engrossed and that's smth that belongs your talent.   My only suggestion is to make a part in every chapter where you explain what should be explained. Coz no one reads author notes... that's why I believe it would be better if you make those parts visible to readers so they could understand and read them.

Anyways  this fantasy story is all about how an mythological women was born in an fantasy world (sort of?) and presumably sent to the real world itself to discover the feelings of the real human world.   The paragraph was a nice thing catch and you used an one-bold poem at the start.   But the problem is that. Paragraph are dizzying and the dialogue is quite lacking but great though.                                                
0 | PROLOGUE,mnsjohns,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc I have mixed emotions on having the entire poem...I like it but at the same time maybe using only 1 or 2 of sentences would be more powerful.  I liked the chapter. I got a lost on the dialogue...mostly confused on who was speaking.  Your descriptive skills are amazing. I loved how I could envision everything.  I'll keep on reading on my own.                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,mnsjohns,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc This is a very strong sentence                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,killemwithkindness98,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc I suggest you split this because it is two different people speaking                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,killemwithkindness98,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc this is most definitely an interesting tale. It's not often you come across a unique take on a popular clich√©. You've brought abiut the mystery elements really well. I'm a little confused as to what happened but I'm willing to read more and find out. You should probably split the dialogues clearly though because it can become confusing.  There was a lot going on in this chapter so it was difficult to keep up but nevertheless an interesting take on things and great descriptive skills!                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,its_me_lulu,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc   Loving how you started with a poem                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,its_me_lulu,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc  I love how  you grabbed my attention first with a poem and how unique the plot is  its nice to see. I suggest you proofread this in terms if dialogue  this must be difficult to write i understand because this genre is hard to make it sound realistic. Good work                                               
0 | PROLOGUE,aishafanfiction,Jul-27 2017," #believerbc  Let me start off by apologizing for this long overdue critic. I've been studying for exams and have been tight on schedule:(   I really don't know why I didn't like the organization of this chapter. It was messy when it came to the dialogues in this chapter. I feel like it would have been much better if you added a new paragraph for another dialogue for example:  ""Don't do that! ""  ""Why not? ""  This is so that it's easier for readers to read the chapter without getting confused. I did however like the poem at the beginning but it didn't capture much of my attention and this is me speaking from a person who likes reading poems. I felt like it didn't really relate much to the story.  However it is a good chapter and with editing"  it can be better!                                                
0 | PROLOGUE,okaynel,Jul-25 2017, #believerbc  Great job starting with a poem! This chapter was really good and caught my attention! I really like how it's like mythology but it's not the same Gods! I love how you introduced us to the characters wants and desires without telling who it is! Great chapter so far! Keep up the good work!                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,Jenjibread,Jul-25 2017,@believerbc  I love how you started off with a poem ^-^ For someone who really likes poetry  this actually really grabbed my attention. I really really like the pacing of this chapter. The emotion of the shade seemed really real  as well as that of the narrator. Somehow I don't know who this is  but I know her aims and ambitions. That is a really cool way to characterize. Even though I understand that the italics are meant to stress some thoughts  there were a bit too much of those. Like the ending with the italic was perfect. But for there to be some in nearly every text made it harder for me to focus on the rest of the paragraph.                                             
0 | PROLOGUE,_hiimstay,Jul-25 2017, #believerbc Firstly  the idea of this story is genius. I usually like mythology woven into a story  but it becomes ten times better when the mythology is a new  original one that the author created. I think you handled this topic incredibly well  the characters read like almighty celestial beings and your writing style is so whimsical. I really enjoyed the tension you've built so far and the question that arose with it. Great job!                                             
0 | PROLOGUE,hungryebi,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  I love this!! You've written all of it so beautifully it makes ur story interesting. Also you've successfully builds suspense in the story and I'm excited to read on. You've done well and honestly there's so much to learn from u :-)                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,ghostcore,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc   I love magic! Your story seems very hard to write. I just don't get how your characters are so serious. Mine are like everywhere and try to act badass but then they fail. Try to put some space between your dialogue.you made it seem like the drama was coming soon.  I wanna know more about your character!! It's good that you have readers asking you questions. You didn't put a lot of information for the story to be killed because a lot of authors do that.                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,ghostcore,Jul-24 2017,@believerbc   This is really deep dude. Not even i would come up with something like that.   I would come up with something like   There was lust in my eyes and pizza in my mouth üòÇüòÇ                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,PistachioJoe,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  beautiful. beautiful. beautiful. i'm loving the entire aspect of royalty that you've incorporated; it really makes the entire story seem that much more interesting! you represented the shade very well-- nothing awkward there. his presence is intimidating but also pretty frustrating  especially when he doesn't grant the MC's wish. your descriptions weren't too long nor too short and i really enjoyed that. sometimes stories like these seem to drawl on forever  and this one gives me just the right amount of detail. you really had me on the edge of my seat with the footsteps and noises. i was scared for her too!                                               
0 | PROLOGUE,PistachioJoe,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  for some reason  this paragraph really captures me. i love your wording.                                                
0 | PROLOGUE,guesswhojustt,Jul-24 2017,Yesss  magic! With royalty and a system! Hard to write  fun to read. For improvements  well  there were some areas where the dialogue didn't have a space between it even though the speakers changed  but quick editing can fix that  so. The explanation in the bold was interesting  and I've ended up hoping  though she got little screentime  that this POV character would end up being queen. The description and the opening writing both promise drama  and you've definitely set the stage for some epic stuff to go down  so good job! #bbc                                      
0 | PROLOGUE,devinjacob,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  I like where this is going though. I'm curious to find out about the blood magic stuff. How does she know it?                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,devinjacob,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  It's an interesting premise. I like how you didn't get to bogged down with history in this chapter. That's a big turn off for fantasy when right in the beginning all there is is history.

0 | PROLOGUE,devinjacob,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  She was twelve feet tall?   Did you mean to write that in the past tense?                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,Spruce_Goose,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  This is an interesting premise and I am certainly intrigued with the future of this book. Your MC seems to be determined to get what they want  using the sass in order to do it which is quite cool  I love a good sassy MC!  The description on this was impeccable  particularly the opening where you describe the blood ritual  that was amazing. I was certainly able to picture exactly what you were describing which was fabulous!  The ending left me with a lot of question! Who is this person? What the frick are they so tall? What does it all mean? - These questions are great  particularly if you are looking to hook the reader in for me  these questions certainly do that!  My only criticism  or perhaps pet peeve  would be the spacing for some of the dialogue. For me  particularly further down  it's too bunched up and looks like it's one person talking  especially with the lack of tags in the dialogue. So that's maybe something to be looked at later on.   Over all  this is a great start and I look forward to reading what happens next!                                     
0 | PROLOGUE,Spruce_Goose,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  Straight to the point with the wish thing xD Sassy character is sassy                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,Spruce_Goose,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  This is an amazing description  seriously  it is just so good. It leaves a lot of questions  like what is doing this to the person? Why are they doing it?   So good!!                                              
0 | PROLOGUE,MyDreamCatcher1220,Jul-23 2017, #BelieverBC  The part about the mother added some drama and some life to the story so that was a good call. It makes me want to keep reading to see what happens next. The description of how they meet was good. So far good chapter better than Part one. Good job

0 | PROLOGUE,imaptient14,Jul-22 2017, #believer bc  A very compelling first chapter! I think you write well. Good descriptions! There is also a sense of urgency that is required for the plot of the chapter. I like the mystery surrounding the POV too. Not many grammatical mistakes that I saw. A great start!

0 | PROLOGUE,imaptient14,Jul-22 2017, #believer bc.   I disagree with the earlier comment. I'd leave it as is. The simplicity gives it power. Great opening line.

0 | PROLOGUE,InfiniteMiracle,Jul-22 2017, #believerbc  This prologue is amazing and incredibly well-written. I can't believe this book doesn't have more reads. I honestly think that this is the kind of book that should be published. If I saw it in the store  I would probably buy it.  As I was reading it  I was able to picture everything that you were describing like a movie. Your language is fantastic  and it does a great job aiding your descriptions.  I love this story already  and I can't wait to see where you go with it.                                             
0 | PROLOGUE,InfiniteMiracle,Jul-22 2017, #believerbc  Nice opening line!                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,sweetxkiwi,Jul-22 2017, #BelieverBc The prologue is simply well written and captivating that I just keep imagining the scenes in my head and it just feels more like a movie  and the description is just amazing and it helps as making things seem more real in my imagination.  I also love the way you portrayed the characters  and the exchange of dialogue it just makes the prologue more and more interesting. I actually didn't notice any mistakes or typos  so good job.

0 | PROLOGUE,Davrielle,Jul-22 2017, #BelieverBC  Overall the chapter was  well written. However I did have some issues with it  and I'll explain the the best that I can. First  as a prologue  it feels more like a chapter one. A prologue should be shorter  so I would reconsider the titling of this piece. Second  you use a lot of suddenly  and thens in the narrative. The problem with using words like And then  or suddenly  is that it takes away from the immediacy of the scene. We are taken away from the story by thinking of the word suddenly " so it becomes something that kind of weakens the narrative. In dialogue I can see it working. We say ""all of a sudden"" a lot"  so keep that in mind too.   I also feel that there is too much about the main character and the shade. Like I feel that there's being too much thrown in a prologue. I really feel like if you want to worldbuild Endollon  you should focus on the Regnants in the following chapter and leave world building out of the prologue (if you decide to keep it as a prologue). Prologues should be teasers  and I feel that there is just too much info in this. I know I said that already  but it's something that I think could be worked on for this prologue.    Now what I liked a lot was the way you handled most of the descriptions. Nothing was lacking in meat  and the voice was pretty strong all the way through  so I compliment that and your ability to continue writing with precise lines. There was the line I loved the most and it was the dialogue with the shade. For some reason I felt the shade being raspy voiced  and when I read that it had a raspy voice  I wondered why I felt like that. I noticed that the shade needs more description of raspy stuff  but I feel like thatmight have been why since it's shadowy and almost ghost like.   Overall this is an enjoyable read  even if it was a little heavy on the detail for a prologue.                              
0 | PROLOGUE,Davrielle,Jul-22 2017,I think you could use an em-dash instead of a comma. If you use it like that  it sounds like you're speaking to someone named hazy. #BelieverBC                                                
0 | PROLOGUE,rubyruins,Jul-22 2017,Okay! üòÅ I'll remove the first 'then'                                                 
0 | PROLOGUE,LisaVanDerMolen,Jul-22 2017, #believerbc   I noticed some parallelism here and there but nothing major that couldn't be fixed without editing. So far I'm really liking it  especially knowing how much effort you put into it. There were a few grammatical mistakes but nothing that the other readers didn't point out already. Keep the good work up!

0 | PROLOGUE,Sunburn_11,Jul-22 2017, #leisurely   What a start! You left me with so many questions that require me to read on to answer them  it was the perfect prologue in my opinion.  I pointed out that you needed to separate a few sentences that were combined together  this is so we as the readers can see it better. But that was the only error I found in this chapter.  The poem above the prologue was perfect and set the tone of the story to come. I loved it!

0 | PROLOGUE,cdsheridan,Jul-12 2017,Okay. Whoa. Lots going on here. There are definitely some grammatical things to watch out for ‚Äî I marked some but not all of them. I think it might help if you just say out loud what you're trying to write down  and then transcribe it ‚Äî some of the phrases you've got here aren't flowing quite right  and that might help fix it. But hot DAMN have you got a story going! And between grammar and flair  it's WAY better to have flair. Fixing the grammatical issues will help your readers follow your plot a little easier  but in general  this is a really great start!   Also  I'm not sure if it's intentional  but the shade she summons has some snark  and I LOVE that. Moments of humor in desperate scenes are my favorite.

0 | PROLOGUE,castiehl,Jul-10 2017, #believerbc DUN DUN DUN!!!! What a start! Intriguing  sets the tone straight away  draws you in... fantastic!  My only issue would be that this book had the misfortune of being on wattpad - this deserves to be a published book  as I do not doubt your writing ability  for it is amazing  but I feel there is too much information for wattpad readers to fully retain at the beginning  that's all.  Finally  be careful with tense. It's already been mentioned so I'll be brief - stick to one and try not slipping into another.  Fantastic start!                                          
0 | PROLOGUE,rubyruins,Jun-27 2017,Hey  I just changed this part a bit. Is it better now? @secretswansong                                                
0 | PROLOGUE,secretswansong,Jun-26 2017,I don't like sentences like this " like ""little did i know"" or ""how very wrong i was."" It doesn't follow the first person pov"  the character shouldn't have known of this woman  indeed. It would be better/accurate if you wrote this in third person. BUT it contributes to the overall effect of this chapter " and it's really good! It outweighs the first three sentences of this comment üòÇ so I suggest you minimize / completely avoid this kind of sentence if you're sticking with first person views. Find a way to rephrase ""little did i know that someone else was watching me"" so that it sticks to first person"

Overall  she is not a self-insert level character nor a "Mary Sue"  and there an indication of much growth to come so I'll stick around to see how this plays out; the chapter length if both satisfying and daunting.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,llmattison,Oct-04 2018,@rubyruins #GraphicPrice This is a very interesting chapter and Edna is an interesting character. I was surprised to see this chapter has a modern setting. The pace and description are good but I did have a bit of a peeve with some of the story. üí¢  When Edna was talking about her wealth  upbringing (and etc) it became repetitive and way stretched-out in some areas. Like where she lives  her brand begs  she donates  has a very very very very very very big important business.üí£üí•  Speaking of Edna  she seems like she's a Mary Sue a little. She came from an unknown past and with a little bit of help in the right direction  she became a rich woman who donates a lot of money to the less fortunate and has an amazing behaviour and manners. Then it gets betterüë†üíÑüíéüíç . . .  She's going to be a Queen. üë∏üëë   The fact she's dying doesn't overshadow she's an over-achiever who seems not to be dying anytime soon now.üòï  I love the storyline and theme so far though.üíñ

1 | ACT I SCENE I,MissVictorian,Sep-06 2018,I would be more careful with  adverbs if I were you. Adverbs really make a sentence a little choppy in my opinion.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,celestia-starlight,Aug-20 2018,Mirelle! I'm still so confused on what role she plays in the story.  I'm gonna take this opportunity to tell you that your foreshadowings skills are total goals. Like what I said before about the mystery thing  you manage to conceal enough to not spoil anything  but somehow also manage to reveal just enough to keep us a) ultra excited  b) making wild theories  or c) dying for an update. Or in my cases it's usually all three.

It doesn't really feel like it; her use of the word "etherized" when modern ORs use general anatheisa and a little kid selling stuff on the street without any adult nearby  it feels very much like the Breakfast at Tiffany's time period (whichever year that was!)

1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,What time period is this set in by chance?                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,This is a good scene  even just getting told "there's nothing more we can do  you're gonna die" Edna still has the compassion to take pity on a little girl trying to make some money with homemade amulets.                                              
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,I think you can cut this bit here  you've already said she's sad  saying it again is overkill.                                              
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,I think you could remove this line and just leave it at "by those standards  I was the poorest person I knew". It's establishing the same fact and doing so in a way that feels more emotional I think.                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,This is a really good paragraph. Even with all the success she's had  Enda still has regrets and I think including them is a really good portrayal of how death affects people-they really start thinking of what matters versus material possessions.                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,Go Edna!                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,I'd combine this line with the four beneath it  having them standalone really breaks up the flow of the writing. Having them together makes it feel more like Edna is reflecting on her impending death.                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,I'd remove this line  it's already established that her death is imminent (once and for all is a pretty powerful statement on its own). Having this just feels really redundant to me.                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,Now this might be a good place to have that line about her being unable to see her beauty and how it's superficial anyways. It'd feel a lot more natural here as she's reflecting on how she's so young and has so much ahead of her and is facing this reality of dying.                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,I'd combine these doctor introductions into one paragraph. Groups the topic a little more.                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jamie-Michelle,Aug-16 2018,This line doesn't make much sense to me  how does her voice being broken lead into beauty? It doesn't strike me as a natural thought process. Might want to relocate the line "despite the beauty" bit to a better place where t might feel like a more natural introduction.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,kalaxis,Jul-20 2018,Interesting first chapter by diving right into the start of the story instead of easing us into it. Nothing much to comment in it  just try work more only using adjectives went needed  if you can cut it out then do.   Love how you conveyed emotions through your characters as well with introducing them without interrupting the flow of the story.                                              
1 | ACT I SCENE I,kalaxis,Jul-20 2018,Wow  I don't think I would've chosen that route. says a lot about her character

1 | ACT I SCENE I,bubblygirl2202,Jul-17 2018,Coming into this book  I honestly did not expect it to be so amazing.   The beginning introduction was at first off putting for a someone who tends to read nonfiction books. But once the story had started  I was simply amazed at your writing style.  It's intricacies are intoxicating and I simply love how you describe characters. I would just be careful to not confuse purple prose with as good imagery or an advanced writing style.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,justlikecallie,Dec-08 2017,I am loving this. Actually a lot of terminally ill people choose to forgo additional medical intervention and die on their own terms with a sense of dignity. They usually get hospice care.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,justlikecallie,Dec-08 2017,It's actually even smaller than a 1% chance of survival if it's 1 to 5 000. That would be 0.02% which is hilariously small.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,Pennywithaney,Oct-10 2017,I totally think the little girl was a test. Like the beggar woman from Beauty and the Beast or maybe something similar to Hestia from Greek Mythology (like the goddess of the Hearth or something. Not sure why I'm getting that vibe  but I am).  And as for babbling/disappearing  I have one word: magic. Same thing for how the people got into her penthouse.  And the talk of the future queen means basically that Edna is destined for greatness which is great because Edna is great. I love her character. She seems honest and strong. Plus  I'm interested in seeing how she develops.  On another note: I thought it was cool how you started the story off in New York. It was a nice addition especially since most books of this ilk (i.e. Three Dark Crowns  A Song of Ice and Fire  The Crown  etc.) start off in the high-fantasy world of who knows where.   Not that there's anything wrong with that  of course. It just adds to the whole feeling I'm getting from this book.   A nice cool breath of fresh air. A brilliant breath of fresh air.   I can't wait to read more!

1 | ACT I SCENE I,Stardustisinsideme,Sep-08 2017, #believerbc  AHHHHHH! I love this so much! Your writing is just mesmerizing. Anywhoo  Edna is a very complex and interesting character. She started out with not much-being an orphan and all-and built herself up. Yet  she still cares about her community. The girl with the necklaces seems pretty sketch  and I feel like she has something to do with these mysterious people. Your description was on point. Not too little not too much. Your dialogue is also very natural " but I feel almost overwhelmed by the amount of ""-"" you use. I agree they are a helpful tool"  but if they are used to much when they are not really needed  it feels a bit repetitive. Again this is the super picky part of me! üòÇ Amazing job! Very excited to read more! üëåüèΩ                                          
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Stardustisinsideme,Sep-08 2017,I love this description and internal thought  but I am not sure if the last sentence is written correctly. I think it would be a comma between life and but and a period after nonetheless. This is because when you use dashes  the sentence should flow even if you take them out. At least that is what I remember from 8th grade English class last year üòÇ. It's super picky  but I just want to help make this story the best it can be ‚ù§Ô∏è.   #believerbc

But now  I know what I'm missing.... I keep wondering " ""Is it the genre" " or is it just the wonderful work piece by the author?"" Either case"  I'm hooked  Edna seems like a lovely character. I'll be sure to read more about her. No errors spotted from my side. Great job

1 | ACT I SCENE I,ReneeShantel,Aug-20 2017,First thing's first: your writing is spectacular.   Your description is balanced really well with the action  and that's something that a lot of people struggle with  so nicely done! I like how you've introduced Edna  too. I like her already -- smart  charitable  and with an incurable heart condition. It'll be interesting to see if any of that changes!   And I wonder who these people are  and why one of them shared her eye colour. That made for a nice little addition!                                          
1 | ACT I SCENE I,percyandannabethrule,Aug-20 2017,Repetition of how much the pain is. Try to spread the pain into different ways of saying it. Also who is Sophia? Is she a friend of Edna's or not?

1 | ACT I SCENE I,heyyitsjasmine01,Aug-12 2017, #BGBC  This chapter was amazing! I love the descriptions  and all of the emotions throughout the chapter. I can feel her pain  and it was beautifully written.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,heyyitsjasmine01,Aug-12 2017, #BGBC  You are so great at writing! These sentences are amazing  and have so much emotion

1 | ACT I SCENE I,GravityWillFall01,Aug-12 2017, #BGBC  Okay  I actually liked the argument with the doctors  and telling a bit about her  and who she was  but I think it cloud have spaced out just a little bit because it was sort of an information overload there. But that is just my opinion. You don't have to listen to it. I kinda wanted to see more of Vienna. She was only there for about two minutes it seemed. I liked how she bought the necklaces from the girl  although you could have had it where she gave her multiple hundred dollar bills instead of a five thousand dollar bill because it doesn't sound right-to me at least.   I like how she talked about the value of things and how little they truly mean when you're dying. Also  the ending left a good tail of suspense with these new  interesting characters. Good job.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,-,Aug-05 2017, #Believer BC  I think the last line would read better if worded " ""...and the other in her martini glass."" But that's just me. Simplicity let's words really shine."                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,-,Aug-05 2017, #Believer bc  I really enjoyed this chapter. Your words pull at the readers heart strings. You're a good writer who really think about her characters thoughts and emotions outside of the plot itself. That's very important and many author's don't get that right. I like the mystery at the end. Who the hell are these people? The whole thing feels like a Time Warp which I love! Good work!                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Vixeeey56,Aug-05 2017, #Believerbc   Hello!   This chapter is very emotional  I feel bad for her! I think you used the right words to demonstrate her feelings to us the readers and that made it easy to visualize!   The descriptions were great  and the structured flowed well.                                              
1 | ACT I SCENE I,MadhavaPriyaa,Aug-03 2017, #Leisurely  Edna's story is beautiful and tragic. Your words brought the entire scene to life  and I could watch Edna's journey and emotions  as well as her final acceptance of dying soon. What surprised me were the three people waiting for her  within her private apartment  like they owned the place. Now  they make the entire thing very interesting.  This is a great chapter :)

1 | ACT I SCENE I,MusicgirlXD,Aug-02 2017, #BelieverBC  I felt so bad for Edna at the very beginning. I think I almost cried. It must be so hard for her to go through life with her heart like that knowing she will die at any minute. I can't imagine the pain she must be going through. Very good chapter. I can't wait to see what happens next.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,JasmanianDevil27,Jul-31 2017,Blurted is an uncommon word and even though paragraphs have gone inbetween  this still seems to close to the previous time you used that phrase. I'd suggest changing it to something along the lines of sighed  relented  whispered...

1 | ACT I SCENE I,_hiimstay,Jul-30 2017, #believerbc Yes  I'm wondering all the things you asked. I can't even begin to tell you how much this chapter impacted me and what a good impression it left. Firstly  the lyrics in the beginning are perfect for setting the atmosphere  it was a very wise choice on your part. I'm very curious how everything is connected with the prologue and whether the strangers in her penthouse are gods  but I guess I'll have to wait and see. Your writing style is truly astonishing  I'm amazed how you can convey so much emotion just with your words alone and Edna feels so real  from her struggles to her wishes and everything else. You really know how to craft realistic characters and apart from that sentence that sounded off  there's nothing that stood out to me in s bad way.                                         
1 | ACT I SCENE I,rubyruins,Jul-30 2017,Actually  it's not 'or.' It's 'OR ' as in 'operating room ' the one in hospitals :)                                             
1 | ACT I SCENE I,_hiimstay,Jul-30 2017, #believerbc I can't figure out exactly what is missing  but something feels off about the first sentence. Shouldn't there be something between the 'the' and 'or'?                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,_hiimstay,Jul-30 2017, #believerbc Again with the emotions. This is deeply moving. I love these little sentences because even if they're short  they pack a punch.                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,_hiimstay,Jul-30 2017, #believerbc The emotion in this paragraph comes across so strikingly. I'm terrified for this character already and the chapter just started. Well done!                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,_hiimstay,Jul-30 2017, #believerbc This song is lit!                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,spoiledthot,Jul-29 2017, #believerbc   right off the bat  I absolutely loved how you started this chapter off with a beautiful quote.   I also notice how you watch your punctuation. Your sentences aren't choppy  the flow so well together.   I also love how lengthy your chapters are  they are perfect                                             
1 | ACT I SCENE I,spoiledthot,Jul-29 2017, #believerbc   Time is just one syllable yet it controls our life  what we do  why we do it  how well we do it                                             
1 | ACT I SCENE I,djwinn,Jul-29 2017, #believer BC  What Edna is going through is so sad. She has all the money in the world and yet she still gets to die even after going through all that pain. I can really feel how angry and sad she is.  How did those people get into her house? I'm suspecting they have something to do with the prologue or how do they even know her name?

1 | ACT I SCENE I,christinewonn,Jul-29 2017, #believerbc  I believe there is a slight typo here with the spacing  a very quick fix.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,aiajaberthebooknerd,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc First  wow. Amongst my friends and I  some people I know don't like the books on Wattpad because they think they're all badly written but reading yours  I can honestly say that you would prove them wrong. This is so good! Your grammar  your punctuation  your plot! I can tell that you've put a whole lot of thought and research! There are very few errors and I want to find out who those people are!

1 | ACT I SCENE I,autumnskiess,Jul-28 2017,Please separate this whole paragraph by speakers                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,aishafanfiction,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc  Firstly  someone commented to me saying I was too 'harsh'  " I need to point out that I'm a brutally honest person and majority of the club knows so I don't usually like to keep repeating myself~  I'm pretty sure that if your talking it should be ""Hey" " "" She smiled at him before continuing" " ""I'm excited to see you.""  There should be a capital letter even if it's a continuation of the previous sentence"  it looks much more neater like this and professional books have this in their book dialogues. I'm a bit surprised to see someone doing their research on actual facts and knowledge. There are very few authors that would think twice before putting a chapter out in public without getting everything confirmed first. I commend you on that!   I believe there were quite a number of questions that could easily just be placed in one or two dialogues rather than separating them because it not only takes up a lot of space but it makes the story quite draggy if there were too many dialogues.  I didn't feel as if the descriptions here hit my satisfaction  I'm more of a expressive kind of writer and reader however  it was good enough to help readers visualise the scenario!                                         
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Seargent_Dum_Dum,Jul-28 2017, #BelieverBC So here  we are in the real world in a fantasy setting....so much modern cliche though?   Alright  although your fantasy story is great and grammar and paragraph is great. But the problem is this...  Why would not spaced the dialogue of this story? Just one space away from the dialogue sentence? Okay  you really need to fix that issue  okay?                                            
1 | ACT I SCENE I,killemwithkindness98,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc uh too much dialogue so I can't even pin point what I was gonna refer to. What struck me quite a bit was the last dialogue by the main  it was very gripping!

1 | ACT I SCENE I,killemwithkindness98,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc first off I loved that ending. I'm in awe at your descriptive skills. I see everything taking place before me and its crazy how accurate it is.  You've done well portraying her character  a different take I must say.  You just need to split your dialogue is all. I'm telling you from experience people don't like reading a book that has lots of crammed dialogue  I had to edit my story quite a bit to fix that. Also proofreading is necessary because there are a few awkward sentences which can be fixed easily.  I'm so very amazed at your descriptions  it's not easy getting others to picture what you see but you've done it wonderfully!

1 | ACT I SCENE I,its_me_lulu,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc  I love the way you portrayed your characters  almost opposites and unexpected of what you would usually see in other books. Ednas character is different which i love as it isnt something you would expect. Polish it with a little proofreading it would be perfect. Nice chapter                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jey_Nathan,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc Fantasy isn't really my thing but I must say this is a nice story  I'm drooling for Edna already  I hope that's allowed. I love the sleek and feel of this story. But I think we need more emotions to this story. Edna behaves stiff most times  but this is just the beginning so...I won't fret. Good job tho                                             
1 | ACT I SCENE I,rubyruins,Jul-27 2017,Yes! Many people have had that issue so working on it :) thank you                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Istotanicole,Jul-27 2017,I think it'd be a good idea to separate the paragraphs with your dialogue. Just so it'd be cleaner when showing who's speak and who's not

1 | ACT I SCENE I,auseante,Jul-26 2017, #believerbc  Honestly  Edna (or Edwina  I should say) is not who I expected to take the leading role in this story. I was expecting maybe a girl in a coffee shop  struggling to sustain her needs  so I guess a rich woman with a heart disease isn't really working for me  but I'm curious to see how you'll pull it off! I felt like this chapter was really well-written  though the dashes are a bit distracting and I also found some punctuations (mostly commas) that weren't really necessary to certain sentences  slowing down the reading process. I really liked the cliffhanger at the end; it really hooks you in to read the next chapter! Overall  you did an amazing job with this! :)                                        
1 | ACT I SCENE I,auseante,Jul-26 2017, #believerbc  I really need to start watching that show! :/                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,storm_warning,Jul-25 2017," #believerbc It's nice to see a person that has problems because I see all these characters that have no personalities and are ""perfect"". I actually find it really intriguing how you picked a Edna having a heart condition for a rich girl" " someone who would be known for being ""heartless"" almost. She didn't play the pity party and instead was very strong for what she is going through. She did not want to die and you did a fantastic job on the characterization throughout the chapter. I really liked the cliffhanger at the end because now it's making me wonder how it will all tie in with the modern world and the other world from the prologue. Awesome chapter!"                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,rubyruins,Jul-25 2017,Actually  it's part of the layout. The first word of each chapter is captialized and bold  hence 'so' is capitalised here as well.                                              
1 | ACT I SCENE I,storm_warning,Jul-25 2017," #believerbc Instead of bolding and capitalizing ""SO?"" use ""So?"" and italicize it. That's grammatically correct and you'll still get the emphasis"                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jenjibread,Jul-25 2017,@BelieverBC To be honest " I semi-expected this book to take place in a fantastical land based on your previous chapters (especially the family tree and all that). But I guess the idea of this being in ""our"" world makes it seem a lot more enigmatic. Have I mentioned yet‚Ä¶ I really really like the design you put at the end of each chapter. This is really random"  but it reminds me of actual published books. As for character development " I fully understand Edna's position in society. But I feel like I can't connect to her emotions as much as I did to the ""unknown person"" in the previous chapter."                                             
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Jenjibread,Jul-25 2017,woah                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,guesswhojustt,Jul-25 2017,This was unexpected: seeing Edna in our world  after the intros about fantastical creatures and places. Yet  the ending of course leaves possibilities for what's going on. Other than paragraph separation and maybe the occasional awkward phrasing  I don't see any problems! I like how you used words that were elegant but still aren't forced  like 'concierge' and 'linoleum'  and weaved them into your writing. Plus  you definitely worked up sympathy for her by letting us see her thoughts and feelings about the whole situation (I wonder if she *will* end up dying?) Anyway  congrats on being BOTW  and keep writing! #bbc                                        
1 | ACT I SCENE I,guesswhojustt,Jul-25 2017,great piece of description here :L

1 | ACT I SCENE I,mfnrc18,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc A bit lengthy but you caught my attention and I did not skip any parts. I want to become a doctor someday so when I read the first part about doctors  I perked up and read all the way.   My eyes kind of got irritated with the dashes and commas. Maybe lessen them a bit? There were no grammatical mistakes and I like the format. Try italicizing the dialogues and separate it from the others to make it stand out and to know who said it.   I loves how you went into such detail and you did not fail to describe everything. My heart melted at the thoughts of Edna not wanting to die. I have a big feeling she won't considering who she saw in front of her. I was shocked with the name the person said. I guess Edwina is short for Edna? It's my first time to encounter that name  so...  I also have a hunch that she came from a world of gods and goddesses and she just chose to live a human life here on Earth. I dunno what exactly I'm thinking right now haha. I would love to read more of it.

1 | ACT I SCENE I,ghostcore,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc   I can see that you have done your research! Good job! I was shocked to see that your story takes place in our world. I was like WHAAAAATTT but I said it in a good way. You put emotions and a lot of questions to be answered later in the chapters.   You did put a lot of information there but that can fixed if you want to!                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,ghostcore,Jul-24 2017,Only if you want.... Try to take out the penthouse part because it doesn't really fit...                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,ghostcore,Jul-24 2017,This comment may be offensive. Holy shit does take place in the modern times                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,devinjacob,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  I also really enjoyed the ending too. It's a very nice Cliff hangar. Makes me curious as how Edna knows them or better yet how they know her!                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,devinjacob,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  I like Edna as a character. I think her situation with the heart problems are awesome especially since you've made her so wealthy. Great drama there.   Your details are also really well thought out. I like how you've clearly researched what a life of affluence looks like in New York                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,devinjacob,Jul-24 2017," #believerbc  Nice line here.   Maybe try ""one finger on her pen (since no one uses quills to write anymore) and the other in her martini glass.""  I also want to take the time to say that it seems like you've researched pretty thoroughly what qualifies as a place on sacs fifth. The details of her wealth such as the style of the penthouse and who her neighbors are (100 million in liquid assets) seem very believable. Nice work."                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,devinjacob,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  They have five thousand dollars bills?!                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Spruce_Goose,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  Again  this is a fantastic chapter! It holds enough emotional and curiosity to hold the reader's attention which is really great! The description is amazing and the emotion you convey in the hospital is great.  Again  as I pointed out  I do have an issue with the huge dialogue paragraphs. When it's being read on a computer screen  it's quite hard to read through the whole thing  particularly as there is a lack of dialogue tags. It makes it impossible to distinguish who is saying what. I would suggest separating it out more so that it is easy on the reader's eyes.  Also  the information dump is a little bit of an issue. We find out a lot about the character and it is hard to process it all and remember every little detail. You could try filtering all this information throughout the book rather than just unloading it as has been done here. That way it'll be easier to read and process everything.  This is a good start  though!                                         
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Spruce_Goose,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  This is one of the things I pointed out in my previous comment  the huge paragraphs with dialogue. Due to the lack of dialogue  it is really hard to tell who's speaking when and what's going on. Online  it messes with your eyes a little  I would suggest separating this out.                                            
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Spruce_Goose,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  Maybe it's just me  but the way she describes herself comes across as a little conceited  but that might just be me xD                                              
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Spruce_Goose,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc  This one liner is great because it packs a punch and really tells the reader what was at stake at this moment in time. Great job!                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,MikaelaMikhail,Jul-23 2017,First of all  Edna has her priorities sorted out. Who will claim the Iron Throne? She'll never find out if she dies now. Haha. Starting out with a strong female lead and a solid background is really interesting. I like the life she's leading now except for her heart problem. Edna is so generous and kind. The Gods must have heard the little girl's thankful wishes when she sold Edna all that amulets. Or....what if Edna has already died....and the ending of this chapter is the start of her afterlife?   #believerbc                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,imaptient14,Jul-22 2017, #believer bc  I love the cross-over feel. The first chapter felt very old  but this one feels modern. You've added a lot of emotion and sympathy here. I feel for he main charcaters  and her debate with how to end her life is a relatable one. I'm very curious about what all of this means at the end...good mystery! You have some spacing issues with your dialoge  (those paragraphs are all scrunched together)  but no other major errors that I saw. I really like the tone  overall. Good work!                                            
1 | ACT I SCENE I,imaptient14,Jul-22 2017, #believer bc  Impressive! Sad about the heart though üôÅ                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,InfiniteMiracle,Jul-22 2017, #believerbc  I love how you're able to convey emotion throughout this chapter. Once again  you did a great job with the descriptions.  I really liked how  upon learning of her imminent death  she refused to stay at the hospital. Instead  she decided to die on her own terms. Although  I really hope that somehow she doesn't die because I really like her.  You did a great job ending this chapter. They left me as the reader with questions wondering who these people were  why they were there  and how they've gotten into her home.  Another thing I really liked about this chapter was the repetition of thing she could never do again. I think it really helps convey her emotions.  This is a great story  and I look forward to seeing how you continue to develop it in further chapters.                                        
1 | ACT I SCENE I,sweetxkiwi,Jul-22 2017,This comment may be offensive.  #BelieverBC  god  the cliffhanger " I was literally like ""WHAAAAAATTT WHAT'S HAPPENING OH SHIT."" it's undoubtedly one hell of a way to end an amazing chapter. And I actually feel sorry for the character"  and with the way you portrayed her character I almost felt her pain and I can't wait to find out what's going to happen to her next. I find this chapter really well written  even its length is just fine  it's not short  and it's not that long that it gets boring  it's simply good. Great job!                                         
1 | ACT I SCENE I,sweetxkiwi,Jul-22 2017, #believerBC Omg whaaaat Now I'm scared for the character                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,breakingbones98,Jul-22 2017, #believerbc  I want to start this off by saying I really enjoyed this chapter. The dialogue was very smooth and the whole chapter has really nice pacing. It didn't feel rushed or too slow.  That being said  some parts seemed very confusing at parts. A lot of characters  complete with full names and descriptions were thrown at once. I had to scroll up to remember who was who a few times. It also seemed a bit jarring to have a character named Robin Williams  considering he was a big public figure.  There was also a few gramatical type issues that took away from the story. You referred to Robin as Robbins at one point " which an s at the end usually is reserved for a last name. The phrasing of ""Vienna let go of the leash on her pet poodle" " running over to wrap her arms around me"" implies that the poodle wrapped it's arms around Edna. Terrifying.   But"  I really did enjoy the characters and the use of repetition of the things she could never do again.                                          
1 | ACT I SCENE I,MissSpel,Jul-22 2017," #believerbc  wonderful! your dialogue is very easy to read and realistic at the same time ... I like how characters are ""cut off"" by other characters"  like in real life :P

1 | ACT I SCENE I,Davrielle,Jul-22 2017, #BelieverBC   In the first chapter  I like the conversation she has with Dr. Williams  but it feels like there should be more of a transition from introduction of Edna to Robin Williams  who I can't help but imagine as Robin Williams lol. The scene between her and the doctor is a very good one  and makes me wonder more about the doctor. Something tells me he might have a bigger role  but who knows. The last part of the chapter I liked the best  to be honest. It seems to get right into the meat of the story and makes you wonder what is going on with Edna and how those mysterious men got into her house. Also find it funny that a 28 year old reluctant socialite won a Pulitzer. It is kind of reminiscent of Edith Wharton in some ways  since she won the Pulitzer in '21 for The Age of Innocence (my fav lol). Overall  I wonder where the story is going now and it has been a very enjoyable read!                                        
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Davrielle,Jul-22 2017, #believerBC   The first sentence is a run-on  so I would work on finding where the punctuation is missing and find ways to shorten it.                                               
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Davrielle,Jul-22 2017, #BelieverBC   intentional or not?                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,LisaVanDerMolen,Jul-22 2017, #believerbc   It isn't often that I see literary devices used on wattpad. I definitely loved the last sentence it just gave me goosebumps for some weird reason. And your descriptions are on point! Keep the good work up!                                                
1 | ACT I SCENE I,Sunburn_11,Jul-22 2017, #leisurely   Maybe it's just my phone  but a lot of your paragraphs were combined together just like the ones I pointed out in the last chapter  expect this time longer. With these I had trouble following along  and it would look much better spread out too. But then again  it might just be my phone.  Edna seems like the epitome of a independent woman and I love her for that. This chapter took us on a emotional rollarcoaster with her and I feel like I know her already.  The bundled up paragraphs are the only I saw that needed to be fixed. The ending would keep anyone wanting to read more!

1 | ACT I SCENE I,castiehl,Jul-10 2017, #believerbc  I love the neighbourhood! and what a song! Is there anything to not like about this book?  I love Edna's character. She makes a stand  she is independent and yet dependent at the same time  she's kind  she relatable as a character. The description helps me visualise her too - she looks just like my character in fact! Spooky!   I like the contrast between the start of the book - all mythological and magical and dark - to this chapter being all mundane and realistic and sad. I half wondered whether I was reviewing the same book tbh. But no - this was a good and clever start. I applaud you. Seriously  publish this book.

2 | ACT I SCENE II,kalaxis,Jul-20 2018,I noticed you like mentioning people's eye color which there's nothing wrong with it. But mentioning their eye colors alone make it a little awkward. When mentioning eyes  use it as a chance to convey emotion and if the color goes hand in hand with it  then that's even better.                                              
2 | ACT I SCENE II,kalaxis,Jul-20 2018,...It's not as cool as kicking it with you... Seriously tho  what a way to start a chapter  lol

2 | ACT I SCENE II,bubblygirl2202,Jul-17 2018,Honestly  I'm so glad that your writing style has simplified from the initial chapters.

2 | ACT I SCENE II,QueenOfRandoms,Sep-11 2017,I don't think it possible for her to use her hands if it is being held back by the woman. Maybe try to word it differently  'Before she was able to pull my hands behind my back  I snatched the glass from the table....'

2 | ACT I SCENE II,Stardustisinsideme,Sep-08 2017, #believerbc  Another great chapter! Again  I think the dialogue is so well written " but the excessive ""-"" makes it choppy to the readers (at least me üòú). I think the people might be her family or something. I wonder why exactly they put her in that pain? Pretty sucky father if you ask me üòÇ. I think the length is very good and the characters are really blossoming. Her actions were a bit repetitive in this chapter which was actually kind of good. It mimics how a person would actually act in this kind of situation. So props to staying true to the character! Amazing job! ‚ù§Ô∏è"                                              
2 | ACT I SCENE II,Jey_Nathan,Sep-07 2017, #believerbc Captivating  I love Edna's spirit  she's strong she has the Aura of royalty. Too bad she's sick. But I think her mysterious new family who seemingly put her in that condition in the first place would know how to fix her. Really excellent. I'd rate this 9/10. You're a really Good author  and I'm just realizing that now.üòòüòòüòò

2 | ACT I SCENE II,thelittlewreck,Aug-28 2017, #Believer BC Noooo I don't want this chapter to be over!!! It was so intese!!!   I love the fast dialogues between the three! It made me feel like Edna has no clue what they are talking about üòÖ   I hope they can save her from dying. Because they definately know what is wrong with her heart.                                                
2 | ACT I SCENE II,thelittlewreck,Aug-28 2017,Hhmmm Queen you say?

2 | ACT I SCENE II,hermoine20,Aug-27 2017, #bbc such a interesting plot! I'm curious about the people and also abkut what's going on with Edna! As I told you before  I couldn't find anything that i felt was out of place and it was pretty flawless! Really excited to read the other chapters! :-)

2 | ACT I SCENE II,ReneeShantel,Aug-20 2017,So it seems to me like Edna is from another world  and these people are her real family -- though why did she need to be protected until she was able to ascend? Hmm. Only time will tell  right? =P   I would have liked to see a little more description about these characters here  but I imagine they get more introduced as the story goes on. That being said  I can't wait to learn more about them -- and more about Edna's life!   Very well written  and what a gripping plot!                                           
2 | ACT I SCENE II,X_marks_the_0,Aug-20 2017,If it's her gun " there's a strong chance she'd refer to it as ""my revolver"" due to ownership. #bbc"

2 | ACT I SCENE II,percyandannabethrule,Aug-20 2017,I think that this was a very suspenseful chapter and I'm ALL for it. I think that you just have to critic the emotions and make your characters more round than flat. Amphitrite and Lucius seem to have the same personality  (so far) and it seems like they need more lines so that we know what they really are like. Overall great job on this chapter! #believerbc

2 | ACT I SCENE II,Natashawallflower,Aug-17 2017, #believerbc  OH MY GOD. IT'S THE GODS. Queen Regnant????   Okay  I'm really sleepy at this point  and my mom will probably kill me if I stay up till later so I need to stop reading.  But you are such a talented person. This story is amazing. Edna/Edwina's character is perfectly described. You're revealing bits and bits of information here and there  which subtly lets the reader know more. The context is great  as is the storyline. I love everything about this book.   I noticed a few typos  but whenever I try to correct them  I see someone had already done that xD   But all in all  I love your work and I will definitely be reading more. ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è

2 | ACT I SCENE II,Spark187,Aug-17 2017,I think these people might be her family. I hope they'e not enemies  and what's with this mysterious illness? I think it's probably deliberate. Perhaps there's some potion that can cure her.                                               
2 | ACT I SCENE II,-,Aug-14 2017,Yay! A Greek mythology name (I'm slightly *cough* very *cough* obsessed with Greek mythology). Your writing style is unique and incredible. The story is amazing so far! #BGBC                                                
2 | ACT I SCENE II,polinaiiv,Aug-13 2017, #believerbc This chapter is quite shocking  it is making us all just sit there  not stop reading. I love the plot. This is amazing " I loved how these guys- Eric and that Lord tried to explain her something. It makes us sit there and be all like ""JUST TELL HER"" i loved the story so far and will keep on reading.   I didn't notice any mistakes"  everything is right. Loved it. Well done                                            
2 | ACT I SCENE II,polinaiiv,Aug-13 2017,I already love the character. We can see that she is not like others. Her personality is quite strong.

2 | ACT I SCENE II,Vixeeey56,Aug-11 2017, #Believerbc  lol I like mysteries so  I think if you're doing it on purpose " you're doing pretty good at it. I think it's a good way to keep a reader interested.    I saw minor mistakes that someone already pointed out which was the ""Off."" part.   Well"  character wise  your wrote her really good. I can relate to her in a way  but I'm also interest in the other three.                                           
2 | ACT I SCENE II,Vixeeey56,Aug-11 2017,Good description tho

2 | ACT I SCENE II,aishafanfiction,Aug-09 2017, #believerbc  Im going to apologise for not commenting on the last chapter of my overdue task. Life has been crazy for me right now.  I really love edna now because i relate to her a loy  i know the feeling of hiding your emotions well that sometimes people dont know if im happy or sad or what. I feel sad that she has never allowed herself to let loose for a change  i understand that her dying must play a huge part but life is about risks at times.                                              
2 | ACT I SCENE II,-,Aug-05 2017, #Bc believe  So  I bet you get a lot of comments about people being confused or needing more detail but I love the mystery here. I hate when writers give you absolutely everything. This was a fun chapter to read. The tension wasn't high and the writing was great. I love time travel or dimensional travel  which this story seems to be one of. I pointed out the only distracting grammatical error I saw. Great job!

2 | ACT I SCENE II,MadhavaPriyaa,Aug-03 2017, #Leisurely  I was on the edge of my chair as I read this  and what a gripping chapter it was. From Edna's fury  to the three strangers and their trying to explain; I loved it. I am interested to see where this chapter is heading :)

2 | ACT I SCENE II,JasmanianDevil27,Jul-31 2017, #Leisurely  You need to go into more detail about her surroundings. During the fight  it was like imagining the characters' movements with very little surroundings  and the surroundings that were there were from my imagination.  As she walks into her home is a good time to introduce the overall layout along with one or two finer details that hold emotional value.  Things like tables and chairs are important to mention during action scenes so we know how much space they have to move around.                                              
2 | ACT I SCENE II,JasmanianDevil27,Jul-31 2017, #Leisurely  I'm very confused as to what their positions are. He shrugged her hand off  but when did she put her hand on him and in what way. How close together are they? It's the older guy right?

2 | ACT I SCENE II,rubyruins,Jul-31 2017,Actually  Edna is a person who's very good at hiding her emotions. You're right  she is a cool  calculating person. Yet when you're such a hugely important person  sometimes you have to take snap decisions. That's what she's trying to do here. All her life  she's never allowed herself to lose control yet her greatest regret is the fact that she is dying. And for once  just once  she's allowed herself to do something she would never do

2 | ACT I SCENE II,JasmanianDevil27,Jul-31 2017, #Leisurely  You should show her thoughts here. If I were in her position (well one  I'd probably be sobbing uncontrollably then getting mad at myself for such low self control  and then idk.... Anyways *coughs*) my mind would probably be racing.  I see her as a cool  calculating person so I'd expect her to be thinking a lot about things before she does them. But if she's like going with the flow " maybe add things like ""my heart thumped rapidly" " igniting fear that I might drop dead then and there.""  Emotions are very important because that's what makes the reader sympathize with the character."

2 | ACT I SCENE II,Sunburn_11,Jul-31 2017, #leisurely  Your cliffhangers are truly amazing! This chapter had the perfect sequence of events  it wasn't too rushed or anything. Edna was actually totally cool and stuff  but then that cliffhanger came around and my mouth legit dropped.  The errors you had in this chapter were just misspelled words or words that need to be combined like 'it' and 'is' into 'it's'. Not very major things!                                              
2 | ACT I SCENE II,_hiimstay,Jul-31 2017, #believerbc Your descriptions are so rich and exquisite  but not pointless or just to fill space  I really like that. They make everything flow smoothly and the pacing is just right  not too rushed or too slow. I absolutely love how you've built everything so far. The characters are strong and well defined and they aren't forgettable  the suspense keeps me on the edge of my seat and the twists keep me reading. I can't really find a fault in this chapter or the story so far. Good job!

2 | ACT I SCENE II,spoiledthot,Jul-29 2017, #Believerbc   So far  this book is one of the best books I've ever read on this app  it's so thought out and you can tell you've thought of every single moment and the characters as well. You give the best descriptions and I hope other people will see this.    I love the names that you have given the characters  they fit so well into this book.

2 | ACT I SCENE II,aiajaberthebooknerd,Jul-28 2017, #believerbc So far I have honestly really enjoyed your story. It's so riveting and again so well thought out. The dialogue seems to be accurate for older rich folk and I love how much strength the main character has! Your description in the last chapter and now are wonderful. Not a lot of stories make me want to continue on reading but I do. I think maybe if you just go back and revise  it'll be absolutely perfect!

I could literally see everything play in front of me  you have a natural talent for descriptions  and making the reader want more. Don't let it go to waste. The only downside of the story is that everything is so cramped up  you could add spaces to the dialogue to make it an easier read. Keep the good work up!

2 | ACT I SCENE II,storm_warning,Jul-25 2017, #believerbc Your cliffhangers are awesome! They definitely make you want to keep on reading on to the next chapter. I love Edna as a main character. She's got a great personality and doesn't let her illness keep her from getting pushed around. Edna doesn't care if they're gods. She'll still shoot them! I would put spaces in between the dialogue to make it easier to read. It will also give it better separation on who is talking. Other than that  awesome job and great start to your storyüòä

2 | ACT I SCENE II,mfnrc18,Jul-24 2017," #believerbc I can feel her pain. I know the pain she's feeling because I have costochondritis. It is the inflammation in the sternum and it hurts af if I get stressed or tired or just simply get too excited or happy. It's far from the heart but I can get her pain.  ""You're haven't changed..."" turn it into ""You haven't changed..."" I get this mistakes a lot when I write because of my autocorrect (I dunno how to fix it.)  I really suggest italicizing the dialogues and point out who said it. I was very much confused in who said what in there.   The suspense is killing me and I want to read more but we're only allowed to read 2 of your chapters. Hopefully"  we could get paired up again.  Good job                                               
2 | ACT I SCENE II,mfnrc18,Jul-24 2017,I did not expect that! hahahaha. Poor guy! #believerbc                                                
2 | ACT I SCENE II,ghostcore,Jul-24 2017, #believerbc   There's a tiny problem...you need to put who's talking in your dialogue because I kinda got confused for a second. You have an amazing plot that's for sure. But what im noticing here on Wattpad is that the famous books have crappy grammar but the people don't care because the book has a good plot.   I love modern fantasy. I even have a series of books that im writing that has modern fantasy. You left us with a cliffhanger and I love those. Sometimes it can get a bit of irritating but that's what brings the readers back to your story!                                                
2 | ACT I SCENE II,MikaelaMikhail,Jul-23 2017,I got confused with the dialogues in the first part  especially when they were squabbling and all. I think you need to clearly define who is talking. But other than that  I can see that you put a lot of effort in this! Yes  I've already read the prologue (it was fantastic btw. Very original. How do you kill a God? I will always remember this. A God for a God. Geez  I'm already getting goosebumps from that) and also your author's note (inspirational!) Okay so we have Edna  a modern Manhattan City elite genius and philantropist suddenly clashing with people who don't seem to be from the same world  what with their weird long names and titles. Okay so my theory that this was the start of her afterlife is debunked. Sad. Anyways  I'm just...lol cos here she is...literally dying of heart failure and these people are bantering right in front of her. And I think it's pretty obvious that she's having problems with her health/heart with her gasping and struggling so she shouldn't be surprised that Eric knows about her condition. Okay now another theory. Eric may be a potential lover to Edna right? Haha. Or am I wrong. But anyways  the ending is appropriate with a cliffhanger cos now we know that Edna's condition is actually 'made' and the only reason it's still working despite the ventricle practically dangling in the open is because she's....connected to the Gods/is a God? And that there is a cure... and somehow  I don't know if it's intended or how you manage to do it  but I imagine the new characters to have a British accent? Lol. Btw  the chapters are just nice in length so it's easy to read. Nice work!   #believerbc                                     
2 | ACT I SCENE II,breakingbones98,Jul-22 2017, #believerbc  I have a few issues with this chapter  but most. of them are very small. I love the story  your concept is amazing. Your characters are vibrant and interesting. But some of my problems fall in the wording of things. Sometimes dialogue seemed a bit awkward. Like when she said get out of my penthouse  it seems like she would probably say house or home.  Also  the fact that she gives him ten minutes seemed strange to me. I would not give anyone that time. I also got confused on how she's so shocked to have the guy know it was her heart. If your heart hurt  you'd probably show it by curling in on your chest. To somebody that saw  It'd be like a 50/50 chance between heart and lungs.   I love the story so far  though. It mixes some aspects of mythology with modern fantasy in a way that is really smooth. Keep up the good work. <3.

3 | ACT I SCENE III,llmattison,Oct-05 2018,@rubyruins #GraphicPrice At the beginning of this chapter I was confused at Edna's (now Edwina's) sudden understanding of the world she is in and no mention of the human world at all.  However  I soon understood it since her mind was erased. It's just so weird. Forgetting 15 years of your life. The people she loved  her raise to fortune and such.  But man  her attitude is kind of irritable but she's bearable I guess. She does have a bit of a narcissist tendencies towards others and very self-insured in her intelligence. But now I love to hate her.

3 | ACT I SCENE III,GlowingRevival,Aug-22 2017, #Believerbc The bitter interplay between your characters is delicious to read. The amount of intricacy that you put into the background of this story is no doubt the result of much hard work. There are a couple moments that it is slightly hard to follow because there is simply too much happening in one sentence. I look forward to reading more.                                                
3 | ACT I SCENE III,GlowingRevival,Aug-22 2017,This sentence right here is slightly confusing to me. I think that the freed hand and the kick should be put into separate sentences.

If there is it  might be a volatile one.   All in all an enjoyable chapter.

3 | ACT I SCENE III,MadhavaPriyaa,Aug-03 2017, #Leisurely  The change between Edna and Edwina! What a sheer difference  yet what eerie similarities. This was a refreshing chapter  and I can;t wait to see what happens next :) Tristan seems like the kind of character I would like. Possibly :P And his description was perfect <3  And I don't like the Everlys :P  Can't wait to see what happens next :)  Even if I am not assigned to you  I would most probably read this book :)

3 | ACT I SCENE III,JasmanianDevil27,Aug-03 2017, #leisurely  You've done a great job of giving each character a personality and sticking with it! Too many times I've read a book where all the characters had similar personalities.

3 | ACT I SCENE III,Sunburn_11,Jul-31 2017, #leisurely  It was weird for me to be reading about her as a God since the last chapter she was just a mortal. Maybe it would be better if you talked about how she felt coming back to her own world  just a little bit  before you start talking about this event.  And with this event  I was again expecting more details. Like what her cousins looked like  all of them. The place she and the rest of the gods were in. What the sergeant looked like that fell. And what her own dress looked like. It's the things like this that will allow us to understand your vision for the story more!

I REALLY WANT TO WRITE SOMETHING SWEET AND ENCOURAGING HERE BUT I ALSO REEEEAAALLY WANT TO READ FURTHER SO I'M KEEPING IT SHORT.  LOVED THIS CHAPTER. I ALREADY LOVE THE CONCEPT OF THE BOOK.

You just write a number of booming chapters that ensure that the readers want to read through!

5 | ACT I SCENE V,atena14,Mar-05,This game of power is awesome. I think that the Everlys or the Rotavelles will use sorcery  to put Edna/ Edwina in another dimension ( chapter 1 and 2 ) to have the throne. And I like Edwina  she is harsh  ambitious  helpful and classy. And i love when she roasts all those sexists and annoying guys;  in some way she reminds me Olenna Tyrell. But she is a little too self - confident and I smell this could harm her later. Anyway you have really a beautiful pen.

A lot of authors just drop words and never come back to it  but your story has a starting point an a end point that comes back  full circle. Love it.

5 | ACT I SCENE V,bubblygirl2202,Jul-17 2018,This chapter was REALLY intense and there's so much I can't even include in one comment. I love the family feud and I'm really in suspense about what could be going on behind the curtains. I like the bringing up of the role of women and I think it's a great call to action. The reference to the Bible about coming from a man's rib was a smart inclusion. I'm really liking how this story is going - suspenseful  dramatic  and captivating. This is awesome!

5 | ACT I SCENE V,lllumos,Sep-04 2017,I love the story and the plot  however  at the beginning " in the chapter called ""history has its eyes on you"" - I felt that there were too many information being scattered all at once about the different races that has emerged. And about the family in general.   Fortunately"  It's not that hard to grasp the basic content about the lord of the sky and mother earth - having six children  and their two children -Cosmo and Titania - eventually becoming the rulers when the fall.  But  maybe it would be a good idea to draw a family tree   including ones for the different houses and show how they are linked together- so that the readers could look back on it in order to get a clearer understanding of the characters and the story.  It would be so much easier to get a snapshot view of it- if we ever do need a reference.   Sorry for the super long comment. I hope that I made sense when I typed this all in.   ( it's just an idea )   Overall   I'm enjoying this book üíô I like it.                                        
5 | ACT I SCENE V,lllumos,Sep-04 2017,Lol. Nice                                                
5 | ACT I SCENE V,GlowingRevival,Aug-23 2017, #Believerbc Yes! She will definitely win. She has to win  right? The interactions between your characters is so great to read because of the detailed backstory you infuse everything with. That said  sometimes there is too much. Or the switch between backstory and present tense is a little disorienting. And damn everyone who has it out for Edwina.. Why can't we all just love each other? Because love is boring to read about. I am off to devour more!                                              
5 | ACT I SCENE V,Spark187,Aug-20 2017,I had to laugh at the sexist attitude of Emerick. This is a man who can't control his impulses and he has the gall to insult Edwina. Now  she has to fight to the death because of this idiot. Some Gods just love to kill people  especially each other.  I have a feeling this fight will not end well.

5 | ACT I SCENE V,rubyruins,Jul-11 2017,Hmmm. Maybe. Maybe not. Perhaps you remember that the girl's eyes were blue? Edwina's eyes are blue too (greenish  kind of teal.) Drusilla's eyes are purple - which might look blue from some points.  Or it might be some other goddess who gets introduced later :D Definately not telling üòâ

It seems that the gods have not only immortality but a heightened sense of emotion. I loved the moment when they forgot their swords in their fury. Also  to see the main character from another's perspective was interesting. The only word of caution I will leave you with is to be concise. Long  flowy and beautiful sentences have their place  but confusion does not. I am off to continue  and look forward to what you will write in the future

7 | ACT I SCENE VII,BookGirl_xoxo,Jun-20 2019,Edwina is definitely is justified in her feelings  Tristans family did cause the death of her mother even if Tristan wasn't the one to actually kill her. Then there are also Tristans feelings to consider  he blames her family for the killing of his twin sisters. So while they both seem attracted to each other I don't know if he would even agree  though I assume they already asked him before coming to Edwina (I wonder if they had to threaten to strip his immortality as well?) I still don't really see why she needs to get married anyway  she seems perfectly capable on her own but I guess it would show the other gods that they are united. Anyway I can't wait to see what happens next!üíï

7 | ACT I SCENE VII,rubyruins,Jul-20 2017,Yep. The marriage has to be done  absolutely necessary. There's no way you can have a King and Queen and not have them married. They need to be united  else it won't be long before the country breaks.   They're really  really  badly attracted to each other  in a just-take-me-here kind of way  but is it truly enough? The pure  burning desire exists  but you need to know the person from the heart if you're really going to be with them üòÄ                                        
7 | ACT I SCENE VII,rubyruins,Jul-20 2017,@Tophie_Star  Wow  you really do know her quite well  I feel so glad!üòá Well  you are absolutely right. Edwina is her own person  and she's used to power because she's actually had nothing in the start and she built it up herself - let me clarify with a bit of backstory here?   When Asteria died  well  Elodie too had died. Edwina's father  Lucius was Lord of Dracnesse but he was sentenced to fifty years of imprisonment. Both her parents gone. At the same time  Aidon had his Trials. Which left just Edwina and very small baby  Amphitrite  whom she had no idea how to raise. Oh  and she had half a huge river to defend  along with the combined strength of the really pissed off Valmonts and the greedy Everlys who wanted her part of the Derwent. That was one of the most trying times of her life  and those ghosts never left her. At all.  That's the reason why she feels very  very personal about her family. It's because she's known what it feels to live without them  and she knows how much precious your loved ones can be. Cosmo knew that fully well  and it forced him to threaten her. Because more or less  yes  Edwina is her own person  and she hates it when someone tells her what to do. She lives on her terms. She's seen injustice for too long  especially with the females  always considered the weaker sex in their world. So she tries harder and harder to fight  and it's one of the biggest lost wars of her life when she finally agrees to marry Tristan. Because it bends her to three men's will - her father  Cosmo  and Tristan himself. Besides  as a wife  she'd now have to move from Dracnesse and stay in Tristan's Castle in Stormholt.   And that is the same place where her mother's killer resides too.                      
7 | ACT I SCENE VII,Tophie_Star,Jul-20 2017,I think Edwina wouldn't have agreed had Cosmo not threatened her. And yes  she's taking her mothers death too personally though I wouldn't really blame her for it.   Now  the marriage has to be done. Don't honestly see why she can't marry Tristan--they feel attracted to each other.   Ohh. I wanna read Tristan's reaction. Hope they don't bite their throats off on their wedding though.   Great chapter Ellis....                                              
7 | ACT I SCENE VII,rubyruins,Jul-20 2017,Well... I just wrote it out today Let's see. Next chapter is... üòÖ let's just say you're not gonna be too happy with it.

7 | ACT I SCENE VII,-,Jul-20 2017,I think so. Coz they needed an alliance  obviously? Like Eric is married already to Amphitrite. She might have married Eric otherwise (I think they're kind of okay around each other) but Tristan... üòÖüòÖüò• I'm worried now. Can you post a chapter quicker??

9 | ACT I SCENE IX,Tophie_Star,Jul-30 2017,To me  she doesn't seem like one to pretend just to avoid her wedding. She'd rather do something like run away or crash the wedding but then there is a threat and the coronation to consider. Which leaves the only other option.

9 | ACT I SCENE IX,Tophie_Star,Jul-30 2017,The woman had to have done something to Edwina for her to be fast asleep on her wedding day  though its a wedding she doesnt want to go through with  its also her coronation and Edwina wouldnt miss that.

16 | ACT I SCENE XVI,Imperfetto_Tesoro,Sep-09 2017,This comment may be offensive. Girl let me tell you something! My first three chapters got so much crap the first time I tried my hand in this writing my own work  someone in a bookclub went as far as downright saying she does not like the chapter at all and kept inlining every single flaw. Of course I delete them because that type of negative energy I do not need. Then another set of people were like I should do this and that you know what I did? I took all those crappy opinions and wore them like a freaking armor  I took a few deep breaths and rant to a few good friends. I believed in my story and I just said f*ck it! Went back and improved my chapters that was up and continued to write and today that same crappy book is a multi time award winner! It started out being featured in top 20s  then I reedited and we started winning third places  went back and reedited and we moved to second place! And I believe so much in my story and felt it can do better  I started rewriting that shit. It's been a rough road to where we are now but the challenges made us where we are now. So my advice! Take deep breaths and rant out all your emotions  then go back to the drawing broad with a big f*ck it and WRITE if you believe in your characters WRITE! Don't let them stop you and bring you down!

16 | ACT I SCENE XVI,secretswansong,Sep-09 2017,Your book isn't perfect but it's amazing and don't listen to anyone saying that it doesn't have these two things which I think are the most important things any story should have: 1. Effort 2. Sense And okay let's throw in some Awesomeness

16 | ACT I SCENE XVI,DelhiBelly,Sep-09 2017,And if your book doesn't fit into a genre  that's actually AMAZING. Because it shows that you are doing something so unique that others can't fit it into a category. As a matter of fact  it proves that you are thinking out of the box and probably creating a new genre in its own!

16 | ACT I SCENE XVI,DelhiBelly,Sep-09 2017,I have been on Wattpad since 2015 but my bio says that I joined in June 2017. There's a reason behind it.  Every time someone critiqued my works and saying that it's absolute rubbish  it would always get to my head. I now know that you really shouldn't take it to heart and just plough through it but back then  I didn't. I would start doubting my novels and would eventually delete my account and make another account to post a new  better story. I have made many accounts because of this and this account is the eleventh one (crazy  right?). But now I realise that I shouldn't take it so hard. Haters gonna hate  after all  but your work will still be truly spectacular.                                          
16 | ACT I SCENE XVI,gulabjamuns,Sep-09 2017,See what I did again? I can't seem to stop myself from launching into essays ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è                                                
16 | ACT I SCENE XVI,gulabjamuns,Sep-09 2017,Aw honey  I haven't read it yet  but I think your book seems awesome! It's great that you're trying to break cliches " and the ""keeping the readers afraid of the mc"" part is not only a good way to hook your readers"  it's actually different from other books! Only a few books keep you genuinely worried about the characters (ASOIAF)  but in most of them  you're sure they're gonna come out victorious.  I totally get that thing about being down because of a review. I got one for my story Up  Up and Away once and even though most of it was still in a positive light  the negative parts hit me HARD. They were things I had never stopped to consider. Although I was (and still am) thankful to the reviewer  I began to question why on earth I was even bothering to write in the first place. I began to think that I was the worst writer on the face of the planet  and I was writing the most cringeworthy book of all time. What I decided from that was to not ask for my book to be properly reviewed until after I completed it. That way  I wouldn't break down half-way through and sit in mourning for the death of my confidence. But after a while  most (not all  I guess) of the insecurity wore off  and I felt more confident about writing. And the encouragement of my friends really helped too. If your readers think your work is good  if they like it  then that does half the trick!   Although it's important to actually like what you write  I think it's also natural for you to question parts of your book. Being blind to your own flaws can't possibly be of any help  so it's a good thing if you know where you're going wrong! That way  you can improve. (And not become full of yourself by thinking you've written the best book in the whole wide world.)   As your friend  all my support is with you. I hope you will be able to see your book in good light again soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

29 | ACT II SCENE I,ReneeWar,Aug-12 2019,Nahhh I THINK that Drusilla was the one who summoned the shade because she knew she wasn't going to win and that's why when they were calling the names it was her name instead. And the reason Edwina can only see her is because it was her fate that Drusilla had tried changing when she wished to become Queen  when the spot IS rightfully Edwinas.

29 | ACT II SCENE I,Queenlikescoffee,Sep-07 2018,I think because she is related to the logogram  maybe the small girl which edina in mortal world and Tristan in this world found might be one of the pieces or related to it  because in tvd the key was a human and here also the part could be a human.                                              
29 | ACT II SCENE I,Queenlikescoffee,Sep-07 2018,Oh no  the blood ritual a girl I suppose the one who wanted to be the queen performed was unfinished and from then only Edwina is seeing g the two feet woman which I guess is a Titan.

29 | ACT II SCENE I,sarcasticbitchQueen,Apr-15 2018,So  I reread the prologue  and I know it isn't Druscilla. You are very sneaky author  very sneaky indeed. 'I heard my brother wake up  letting loose a strong of curses  and a female ROTAVELLE voice joined his own.' Who's brother is married to a Rotavelle? Aidon! So that means it's either Amphi or Edwina who performed the blood ritual!

32 | ACT II SCENE IV,GlaireMannon,Dec-23 2017,This comment may be offensive. You know I love this book. It's wonderful it really is  the writing is well done and it's clear that you've thought the story out and have a direction that this is all going in but ; I don't think any of these scenes with the royalty have been properly thought out. Edwina is Queen regnant no matter if they like her or not  no matter if they want money or into her pants her word is law. The fact that these same people can continue to disrespect her  harass her and try to kill her MULTIPLE times WITHOUT punishment is completely unacceptable and amazing to me that NO ONE does anything about this! You could argue that she broke his hand or whatever just happened but that is not what the punishment should be for someone trying to kill THE QUEEN in her own home. These people should be locked away or tied to a rock so their insides can be pecked out by birds for eternity but they should not be given warning after warning without anything being done. Same with Tristan. The scene where he rescues the young girls is insane! A man should NOT be able to WHIP THE KING ACROSS THE FACE and continue breathing! By even disobeying direct orders from him should equal some kind of punishment if not death equal to death. I'm sorry if this seems rude but every time I read about these people calling their QUEEN wench or harlot or trying to kill her AGAIN it just takes me out of the story. I can't imagine that they just let these horrific people continue on with their wicked lives as if they had half as much power as Tristan and Edwina do. I don't know what kind of monarchy these people are running but it clearly isn't effective.

49 | ACT II SCENE XXI,godavariflowsby,Apr-21 2018,I remember the author telling me about this a few chapters ago when I asked why Lucius wanted Edwina to forgive him. I guess I shouldn't have known because it kinda ruined (spoiled) this para for me and perhaps for others as well. I'll refrain from asking questions that will be answered way down the line for sweet suspense.  I won't force you but when people ask questions like I had I'd like you to leave it like a suspense " ""you'll see soon."" Something like that you know.  But of course"  it's all upto you. As a writer I just gave you another weapon to injure your readers with. :-)  G

ACT IV | VIRAGO,MiriamCortinovis,Sep-13 2017,Hello there! Since you've expressed the desire of improving  so I've read this far and now I'm ready to give you a first opinion. You already know what I think of the introduction chapter  so I will focus more on the following two. The plot per se is very unique  so is the world you created and its system. I found the Monarch Trials interesting and the magic the gods wield certainly have potential. Having said that  I'm not sure I'm going to continue your story - here's why. The writing style had appropriate diction and proper grammar  however  I personally found it meagre  almost like a script  with plenty of well-constructed dialogue but no real narrative. Perhaps it was because of the need to explain a lot of stuff (I'lll come back to that)  but to me it felt fast and rushed. It caused  therefore  a lot of confusion in my head  specially with the character  which I wasn't able to identify. Expect for Edna  since it's her point of view  I have only blurry ideas of the other characters mentioned. They are reduced to their names  while I don't have an idea of how they look like  how they act  and what their personality is like. Your way of explaining background is clear and neat  however  I felt that it was definitely too much  to the point I personally don't have a real input to jump and read the next chapter. In many ways  it also felt obvious. I expected she was going to be a god  and that they'd put her on Earth for her protection. Again  the world you created and its players have tons of potential  which I envy  but they are not expressed to their fullest  thus  sounding to me both chaotic and simplistic. Last but not least  in terms of emotions  I personally didn't feel attached to Edna  in particular to her resistance to drink the medicine and come back to her real world. Mostly  it was because I didn't perceive the fifteen years she mentions  didn't feel the attachment she had to her life  despite the first chapter (which  if I may say  kind of (continues)             
ACT IV | VIRAGO,skypillars,Sep-12 2017,HOW CAN PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY DIDNT LIKE YOUR BOOK.TELL ME.I MUST KNOW! (BECAUSE ITS FRAKKING AMAZING!!!

I can see you put your heart and soul into this  so I commend you! I am already getting a very good idea of all the characters so far! Each and every single one is very original. Though the whole chapter I was thinking  what if her friend came in with her poodle üòÇ Anyways I hope this gets published into a hardcopy book. And I could totally imagine this being a movie.

ACT IV | VIRAGO,X_marks_the_0,Aug-20 2017,Try to use less adverbs during dialogue tags. Keep them simple (i.e. he said  she said) so that the action flows. Especially during an information bomb  it's best not to get too caught up on something as benign as a few little words. Otherwise it's great üëç üòä  The one part eating me alive was her heart condition. If it was as bad as the doctors said it was  she wouldn't be allowed to do any strenuous activity. So the prolonged scene in the second chapter where everyone is arguing and Edna has a gun is really stretching it. She would have had problems throughout the whole scene. When the first guy (blondie I believe  lol) appears out of nowhere  that would have given her an awful start.   Plus  holding a gun with the intent to shoot would skyrocket a heart rate. Not sure how much shooting experience you've had  but a gun is a very explosive weapon. A lot can go wrong  especially at such close range. Even if she's been trained to use it  that doesn't change the fight or flight response she would be having in the moment. The movies make it seem like nothing to fire away  but that's far from the reality.  ~ I really loved the opening line. I've done a script with that same first part spoken by Edna  and it really brought a lot back for me to read that. Probably not what you were going for  but I thought I'd share  cause it stuck with me through all 3 chapters. The rest of the dialogue was also quite good  might I say. It's that first line though that did me in!  #bbc

ACT IV | VIRAGO,Spark187,Aug-17 2017,Lots of background information in this chapter  but why do they have a wipe her memories of this world. It all sounds suspicious. With any luck the mind wipe doesn't work and only ends up being temporary. Can't wait to be see what Endollan looks like. I still think her life is in danger. Anyone in power is open to death threats and assassinations.                                                
ACT IV | VIRAGO,Vixeeey56,Aug-12 2017, #Believerbc   Hoping she is gonna become a queen  and I think that fire fits her character lol she's feisty. You organized the information well  I believe through dialogue which I think it was a good way. Although  I do have my suspicion about the story  hmmm.   You do have a few typos  and a few commas mistakes that already seemed to be pointed out  but they are an easy fix with an edit

ACT IV | VIRAGO,_hiimstay,Aug-01 2017, #believerbc Whoa that was a lot of information. All the more reason for me to applaud on you managing to not make it seem info dumpy. I really like how you explained everything  it was very siccing and not overwhelming like it usually is in fantasy book. This is probably because you put your character in the shoes of the readers and so everything came across much clear and in a very original way  not just in clusters and whole paragraphs of information. This chapter peaked my interest regarding the two other realms besides the mortal world. I also noticed how you build your characters little by little and even if it's too soon to say  I think I will be very fond of them. Her family is so easy to trust  but I won't let myself fall for it because there must be something fishy about this whole deal.

ACT IV | VIRAGO,JasmanianDevil27,Aug-01 2017, #Leisurely  So  in a normal  paper book " your paragraphs would be like:  Words      New paragraph.

They think words or make an action.      Someone else starts talking.      Other person responds.  A new setting/topic starts. For example they went to sleep and woke up but the chapter isn't over so you skip a line.      Someone says good morning.      They respond.  But on wattpad"  it often autocorrects your indentations and when you want to comment it will ignore the place where you went down to the next line and put it at the place where you next skip a line. Then  you have this huge block of texts and all the comments get thrown in the same spot.  So typically on wattpad you skip a line instead of just dropping down one.  Not: Blah blah. Blah  blah.  Instead: Blah  blah.  Blah  blah.

ACT IV | VIRAGO,Sunburn_11,Jul-31 2017, #leisurely  This chapter has a lot of information all packed together tightly  so that may be a factor that would confuse a lot of people. The actual information was genius  it all seemed to work together perfectly and everything made immediate sense.   Sometimes when your characters are yelling THEY YELL LIKE THIS! And then other times they yell like this! I would pick either one you wanted and stick with it  not flip over to each side.   When the gods were showing off their powers  I was a little disappointed that you didn't describe it as well as you describe all the other things. It seemed short  just a little paragraph when it deserves more.

But  although they may be a part of it  I feel the Emmerson family is in on it also. They have always struck me as suspicious - too many ill events happening in their presents. And on top of it all  I suspect involvement in some of the servants  Ava included - the wine event could not have been done without it  and of course  everyone suspects the wine was a rues to begin with. Wow  Edwina really has bit off more then she can chew - if I'm even close to accurate lol.

71 | ACT IV SCENE X,prosejoyce,Aug-14 2018,I have a theory!   You see  there were things that were going awfully wrong throughout the last few chapters  starting with when Edwina kissed Eric.   No..   It started when she first saw the Titaness. Ever since then  strange things have been happening. I think that it's because of their presence. Because the only person who knows that they're there is Edwina  so they have everyone turn against her.   Aidon is affected. In the previous chapters  we see how he is with Edwina; he loves her. This isn't how he'd act..   Her sister  Amphitrie  is affected. Llewellyn was affected. Eric. Basically everyone  with the exception of the Rotavelles  because they were always *sshats.   Aidon isn't the one who wants the Cube; the Titans do. It's a whole ploy  to get it and destroy all the gods/goddesses. And they started it  by turning them all on their Queen. They made her feel like an outcast  a murderer.  Plus  she's the only one of them who can figure out how to open the Cube. I refuse to believe that they're all acting like assholes  because she killed the triplets.   Everyone knows Edwina by now and her love for Amphitrite  so they could've easily put down that bullsh*t. Something's affecting them.  I know so..                                  
71 | ACT IV SCENE X,Leannea,Aug-14 2018,Nooooo I can't believe you're doing this to me!! This cliffhanger was excruciating.... I can't believe the pain Edwina must be in right now :'(

I didn't even know why I'm thinks bout this right know i just hope that u let my baby Edwina live and that all these mo-f**kers get what they deserve - which is a really painful d eath                                                
72 | ACT IV SCENE XI,celestia-starlight,Aug-20 2018,Wow. I really love how you describe her pain. (Well  not just hers  but Tristan's too  cause it's mainly them) It's super... relatable  I guess? In a odd kind of way  how you describe their pain  be it physical  mental  psychological  I find really deep and relatable. Even though I've never had (probably never ever will) have injuries on a scale ever vaguely similar to what they experience  I can really feel their will and their desperation  their love and their hatred  all as if they were real people I knew or maybe even me  instead of characters of a book or words on a page. Great job!

I loved Edwina's bravery and sense of unbelievable power and her need to put others before her own. I love Tristan's dynamic personality and that he loves Edwina but he barely tells her that in person. The descriptions are thought-out brilliantly and I could imagine that I was there  ùò∑ùò™ùò∑ùò™ùò•ùò≠ùò∫.

85 | ACT VI SCENE II,sunflowerlies,Nov-27 2018,Look back at everything that's happened I have a feeling that the group might not survive. This is definitely not a cliche story and everyone surviving in the end is so very cliche. As much as I hate to say this I think the chances of Eric  Edwina  amphi and Tristan dying are the biggest                                              
85 | ACT VI SCENE II,maskedst,Nov-27 2018,I have a bad feeling that Tristan won't make it lol

94 | ACT VII SCENE V,Rowaelin_Whitethorn,Feb-24 2019,This story is so beautiful and Edwina and Tristan's love for each other was so pure. I hope to find a love like that one day.

EPILOGUE,SensuousAllure,Jul-29 2019,God. I'm so sad to see this book over honestly. For months I had been going through some stuff and finally decided to get Wattpad again. I'll never forget the day I was looking through the tags Fantasy and found this piece of treasure. I put it in my library  just knowing I had to keep it there and read it. The moment I started to read it  I was completely hooked. Throughout the chapters you made me laugh  cry  (well almost. I was out in public so held back during most chapters) and made me want to write something like this. But unfortunately  as you know I quit writing. But you made me realize how much I miss and loved writing. Also  at the end of all the chapters I remembered that life doesn't all give us a happy ending.   When I say it's hard for me to read sometimes  it definitely is. Sometimes if I'm not interested enough my mind wanders  and I don't really focus on the story. But this  of course I did. From start to finish   . So I want to thank you. Thank you so much for creating this beautiful work of Art. Thank you for giving me inspiration when I least expected it  and thank you for giving me hope and strength when it was most needed. Edwina taught me a lot  but if anything she taught me to be strong and fight  because a Queen NEVER goes down without a fight.                                     
EPILOGUE,SensuousAllure,Jul-29 2019,If you thought it was over  you were wrong. It was never meant to be a happy ending   at least just yet.                                               
EPILOGUE,celestialmoon808,Jul-29 2019,I love this ending but I also hate it. It's satisfying but at the same time it's not  because I want to know who the villain is  but I don't because she or he sounds too dangerous.                                               
EPILOGUE,queenlythefirst,Jul-29 2019,ok  so  this is practically begging for a sequel (great job by the way  had me hooked from beginning to end)  and oh boy does this story deserve it

CAST LIST,ella_officially,Apr-02 2018,I don't think Miriel is Pandora's reincarnation. I think she's that one titan that escaped...?                                                 
CAST LIST,Faffacake,Mar-30 2018,I honestly hope there's a literal skeleton in Tristan's cupboard  Also I'm gonna go all out and say Miriel is one of the original creators of all things  or she at least has a part of them in her. She's obviously special and powerful enough to travel between the human realm and the God's realm  so why not go wild and guess the unlikely?                                               
CAST LIST,sunflowerlies,Mar-28 2018,okay... so I've noticed how you've mentioned a couple of of times that there will be some emotional deaths in the book and ive got this feeling that its gonna be someone very dear and important to me. let me straight to the point...

CAST LIST,-,Mar-28 2018,I like the original one better because it explains the book better

CAST LIST,-,Mar-28 2018,OKAY HERE'S THE QUICK OVERVIEW : I LOVED THE BADASS BLOOD AND REIGNING DESTRUCTION GOING ON IN THE NEW ONE. absolutely ADORED it. i would consume it in all of its blood-red darkness if i could. but i feel like i'm with you on that one  bc i feel like your original one introduces the basic synopsis better

CAST LIST,-,Mar-28 2018,well  my god. the new one you've got cooked up is extremely gory and dazzling in the way dominion and blood is. i absolutely love it. but  i'd be with you on that : the second one would be better for the premise of the story because it introduces the story more  while the first one (which i love to the depths of the infinite universes  may i add) focuses more on the blood that will tear them apart (which  in itself  is also a summary of the whole book)  and i get what you mean! i always get tired of my stuff so quickly. covers  blurbs  you name it

CAST LIST,Leannea,Mar-27 2018,I do like the second one more! For the first one  I'm not the most amazing chess player but the queen is really the most versatile piece on the chessboard  with great range of movement while the king only moves one step at the time  Edwina is def a queen for sure

CAST LIST,sunflowerlies,Mar-27 2018,Okay crazy theory here:  What if Miriel was the recarnation of Pandora? Maybe something happened to her in the process of recarnation  and thus she lost her memory (or she could be pretending) And If I remember correctly she was in tristan's castle the night they found Adam's corpse so maybe miriel instructed her daughter to kill him?

FUN FACTS,zuramaru-,Sep-06 2017,This comment may be offensive. I feel you  fam. The first book is always the hardest but once you write the first chapter it gets easier. You start understanding and knowing what to write about.  Oh yeah... THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TOO MANY CHARACTERS. And if it gets confusing I'm fine with it. Attack On Titan  my personal favorite anime/manga has a crap ton of characters and half of the time I'm like: Dafaq is going on? Why is he the Colossal Titan...? I mean I've seen how fucking tall he is... but he was a sweet  hot guy! How could he be one of humanity's destroyers?!  Buts that's just my thoughts. And if I enjoy this I will read the entire story  even when I'm not in your group.

FUN FACTS,Androme_Deux,Jul-23 2017, #believerbc  When you mentioned that it wasn't going to focus much on Greek mythology " I smiled. It was unique of you to use ""Endollon"" instead. Your descriptions of the gods and goddesses of Endollon were also appreciated. It would be nice though if you also included a short but not too spoiling introduction of your protagonist. That is"  unless  there will be a lot of protagonists. You've mentioned that it was going to be a long story  which meant you probably have a clear vision of how you want this story of yours to go.

FINAL NOTE,Blobbehh,Feb-12,This book made me cry my eyes out like ten times!! I've never been invested in a Wattpad book for so long  usually I get bored within 20 chapters. Literally the best book I've ever read. It has it all  the romance  the action  the horror  comedy  literally every genre!! I give this book at 1000/100 bc it's just that amazing üòâ!! Hope you're doing well author! U made me so so so happy!                                           
FINAL NOTE,frostedlavender,Feb-07,Never have I been so excited to read a book on wattpad. COG is the high quality that I find in best-selling books and kept me up nearly every night. I love everything about this book  even the parts that made me cry and scream in frustration. This book was a trip but it was absolutely a fantastic ride. Not a single other wattpad book has made my favorite books list but this one shot right up there. Like everyone else said  if this book ever got traditionally published I would buy the hell out of it. Imagine if this got picked up to be a netflix series and it was executed as well at the witcher or something. Un-be-lievable! I wasn't expecting this book to be as amazing as it is but now I can't imagine not rereading it. Thank you for your beautiful words Ruby.

FINAL NOTE,strawberrykissesdoll,Nov-13 2019,I just finished the entire book and now I'm going to reread it again... I don't do goodbyes                                                 
FINAL NOTE,fortun8rose,Oct-17 2019,I can't appreciate you enough.  I am so damn happy that I 'stumbled' upon this book. Like I have said before  this book deserves to be published.  Lol   I feel like I would have printed it on my own just to read it in paperback (if it makes any sense at all). I feel so honored to be a part of this journey.  I wish you the best and keep creating masterpieces. ‚ù§‚ù§                                               
FINAL NOTE,Question_AUTHORITY,Sep-28 2019,I have waited a long  long time to write this comment.  From the very first sentence  your story enticed me. You claim that the villains are mere shadows of their potential  but I find them more solid than the phone in my hand. The motivations  the thoughts  the ideals that each character holds close to them make them so distinct  such an individual entity  that it shocked me. The pain that I felt when Tristan died was shocking. The silent sobbing was shocking. The sheer force of your words nearly bowled me over. Hours and hours  I have spent pouring over your work. You point out the flaws  but I want to bring to light the beautiful strengths that it has. The words themselves work alongside you. The imagery is stronger than a Robert Frost poem.  When you doubt yourself  just know that there are people like me. People who are devoted  who would bow down to the crown of words that you wear proudly.                                      
FINAL NOTE,Question_AUTHORITY,Sep-28 2019,The hardest task of all is to building something up  and know that you have to break it down and build it again.                                                
FINAL NOTE,Question_AUTHORITY,Sep-28 2019,More than anything.                                                 
FINAL NOTE,LattyBritish,Aug-27 2019,This book deserves each and every achievement it gets  I remember when it was still in its infant stage now COG is an absolute big deal. Congrats on everything my friend may your journey continue to flourish and prosper fruitfully.

FINAL NOTE,armb6276,Aug-26 2019,But if they're gods and goddessess why would they be celebrating Jesus' birth? Do they believe in Christ? It's a good idea dont get me wrong i'd still love to read it  it's just kinda confusing reading about gods believing in another god                                                
FINAL NOTE,fresabella,Aug-25 2019,Would love to                                                 
FINAL NOTE,-,Aug-15 2019,DAMN I WROTE A WHOLE ASS ESSAY üò≠üò≠                                                 
FINAL NOTE,-,Aug-15 2019,I've been holding this off for a minute now and finally imma say it.  I am not worthy to be reading this book for free. this story  the characters  the feeling  the LIFE you gave to this story is absolutely stunning. I'll be honest and say that the first time I saw this book  I didn't know whether or not to read it but after finally going through every chapter and word that you laid out for your readers? it was so f≈´cking worth it. honestly  I feel as though you did an amazing job with this book. little as you may say you did with this story  I will say you did way more than you give yourself credit for. yes  you could have changed the tides for many of your characters and given them a bit more of what they all individually lacked but at the end of the day  you created a universe filled with awe and wonder. and that's what authors like me aspire to do with their own works. create a space where everything comes to life. and you did that.  so all I have to really say is  thank you. thank you for allowing me to read this beautiful masterpiece you call Crown of Glass. thank you for allowing so many of us to read this book for free. and if you EVER decide to publish this  lord knows I'll be so happy to see this book out in the world but I'll also be happy to purchase it. ‚ù§Ô∏è                                       
FINAL NOTE,-,Aug-15 2019,you are an amazing author. ‚ù§Ô∏è

FINAL NOTE,-,Aug-15 2019,I'm actually fine with no sequel honestly. if anything  this ending to the book made me happy. this entire story alone made me extremely happy to even be able to read this. if at one point you do feel that you need a sequel to this  then please go ahead. but just like every author I've ever read from  allow for your characters to rest. if they're not speaking or wide awake  let them rest. as should you.

FINAL NOTE,burgundoise,Aug-14 2019,Oh. My. Bleeding. Goodness. Where do I begin? I binge-read this whole book over the span of about 8 hours. And I legitimately feel like my life has changed. Ellis  you have left a lasting impact on every single one of your readers. I experience shock  I cried  I got horny (I need to go find some holy water)  I laughed. I laughed maniacally at 3 in the morning. I sobbed at 3 in the evening. You have given me so much life with this book. I admire every drop of sweat  blood and tears that you put into this book. All the details... they are glorious. Every inch of your pages are glorious. Every bit of your calloused fingers and minute if your screentime is glorious. It is wicked  it is wild  and most of all  you glorious goddess of a writer  it is wonderful. Thank you for giving us Crown and Glass. I pray that I shall be plucking this book off my shelf to read to my children  nestled between the works if Mary Shelley and Shakespeare. I pray that box office records are broken with movies inspired by this book. I pray that the actors that portray these characters break Oscar records. I pray that your name goes down in history  and is lauded in Harvard classrooms. Ellis  you have a God-given gift. Thank you for giving us a glimpse of it.                                     
FINAL NOTE,alishasoffeya,Aug-14 2019,everyday i keep waiting for more updates on this book yknow and i get sadder everytime i realise there won't be anymore updates  no more me patiently waiting and ranting and expressing my thoughts of a new chapter to my friends and them laughing along and nodding their heads  no more crying and hoping the best for edwina and tristan  no more scenes of these amazing characters but im happy with the ending no matter how painful the parts before it were so i bid you one last goodbye again - your faithful reader  alisha‚ù§                                             
FINAL NOTE,alishasoffeya,Aug-14 2019,thank god and i don't mean this in a negative way but i don't particularly enjoy sequels that much except for a selected few and it's mainly because it'll start to feel dragged on and i personally love the epilogue and ending. we're talking about gods here and they will live forever so i feel this is good and standalone are the best                                                 
FINAL NOTE,alishasoffeya,Aug-14 2019,god i love this book and i wanted to delay reading this because it would make me cry and it did. thank you so much for this amazing journey and i might actually read your other books but for now i guess i gotta focus on my exams. this book will always be my favourite and no matter what will have a place in my heart along with our dear author ruby here. this book has been with me from the start through thick and thin and i am one impatient person so the fact that i stayed till the end just shows how much i love this book. it captured my attention from the start  from the description of edwina and how she would be queen and her words. this entire book is a masterpiece. goodbye for now‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§                                                
FINAL NOTE,Tophie_Star,Aug-14 2019,üò≠üò≠üò≠ I'm in tears marvelling at how far this book has gone from the very beginning. I remember when I first üåü reading this book. When I convinced you it would go places. You have the potential  the magic of weaving words in an awesome  breathtaking way. And here we are. I'm so glad I am a part of this journey... A part of this spectacular piece that YOU created. I'm proud of you Ells  and I can't wait (cause I'm sure of it) to see Crown Of Glass published cause trust me  it will be. Love you loads Goddess of Fantasy üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç                                            
FINAL NOTE,hermione_chase1,Aug-14 2019,If you do go with it  rest assured I would be reading ot from the start again                                                
FINAL NOTE,hermione_chase1,Aug-14 2019,Is that even a question ??? Of course yes                                                 
FINAL NOTE,hermione_chase1,Aug-14 2019,Can I just say that I'm really happy with your decision. Dont take me wrong. I love this book and I would give anything to read more about edwina and tristan. But I think that a sequel would totally destroy the circle that you have created in this book from the start to the end. I mean the storyline is so perfect with every little thing adding up in the end. So yeah even if I would really like more edwina and tristan   books just have to end. And the ending of this book is perfect                                                
FINAL NOTE,hermione_chase1,Aug-14 2019,Oh my god !!                                                 
FINAL NOTE,NforIAlways,Aug-14 2019,I am gonna start writing again. Today. And you have ZERO idea how much saying this sentence has felt like. I have been here from the start  i have changed with your characters and i have been inspired and felt inferior at the same time because of brilliant you are. I have constantly cursed myself for not writing  for disappointing people around me and this story has helped. It has helped like a friend  like a lover  like an enemy and like a family. YOU have helped. So i just wanna say thank you. Thank you for making me feel better today. Tomorrow. And everytime I will be reading your books

FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,We leave our pieces our heart in everything we love  and this story has a biggest one  I found this story in my recommendation one day  and when I read the first chapter  there were feelings inside me  and the whole book was an emotional roller coaster. You learn alot from books  and this so one of them  edwina has been my motivation  her fierceness and her passion about getting the crown that she wanted  made me realise that you could have anything if you tried it. I can literally go on ranting but really I love this book and I love you author‚ù§                                        
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,Awww we love you so much                                                 
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,Take your time girl                                                 
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,Like duh                                                 
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,Obviously                                                 
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,No I'm glad you didn't give a sequel  I personally don't like them                                                
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,Can I just like this paragraph like a thousand times?

FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,I love it when stories and poetry are like a circle  they just show how planned they are and it just kind of completes the whole thing you know                                                
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,Woah                                                 
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,This last note and this paragraph here shows alot about all the writers  of how they try their everything  they give their everything in each of their character  but obviously one person writing all of those has drawbacks  I like that every character had their own individual varied personality  even though you didn't quite meet your own expectations  I think the characters were great  because you did show a strong women who didn't back down till literally her last breath  who also fought after that. This book is one of my favs for that reason                                         
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,Like that one thing literally started it all                                                 
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,I'm feeling it too  it's too hard to let go.                                                
FINAL NOTE,Queenlikescoffee,Aug-14 2019,I'm gonna miss this so much                                                 
FINAL NOTE,aurynofthemyscira,Aug-13 2019,ILYILYILYüíåüíåüíåüíå I'll miss COG and all the characters for sure and I really really look forward to anything you write in the future                                                 
FINAL NOTE,NConstantina,Aug-13 2019,In regret  blooms growth.  I think in some beautiful  sadistic way  as you are broken down like glass  you are built up stronger than steel until you finally break  or can be broken anymore. This book has a been wonderful ride from start to finish  no matter the flaws. Perhaps  as you quote later in this epilogue  you are most intimate with this book. Meaning you see all its flaws.  Despite those flaws  this book is still incredible. Its still a wonder of neatly tied up plot threads and terrifying villains who kill hundreds with a snap. Its a spectacle of bloody poetry that grabs the reader and doesn't let go. I know I certainly couldn't let go.  Know  that no matter what you decide to do with CoG  whether rewrite it or leave for the internet trolls  that your book has changed me as a person  and as a writer.  Thank you for that. ‚ù§Ô∏è                                    
FINAL NOTE,suga-crush,Aug-13 2019,you helped me believe that I could write and that I could build stories. And writing is something that isnt weird or for smart people only. This was the first time ive cried for a character being tortured to death. Like actual sobbing. I know you get a ton of these but I just wanna say. THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU. And writing about all the fuucked up things are in life and not being afraid to write about women empowerment and the lgbtq community. I love how raw some topics are and how they can hit home sometimes. I will probably reread this in after ive accept that this is the end. And thank you for inspiring me to write!!!

Thank you   I'm finding it really hard to articulate my feeling right now and it making me so frustrated because I dont feel like I'm giving this book the review it deserves. I'm sorry  Because this is hands down the best book I've ever read on or off wattpad  and I've the infernal devices  so to me that's saying a LOT lol  cause I always thought that the infernal devices was the best there ever was.

FINAL NOTE,maskedst,Aug-13 2019,tbh unpopular reader opinion but i agree  i feel like a lot of this book was edwina pov and that kind of left readers to stan edwina and hate on every character who wasn't on her side (unpopular opinion again - edwina is a good person but i didn't like her yeet ppl gonna attacc me)  maybe if u rewrite you could split up books and occasionally add povs of other houses? :D

FINAL NOTE,celestialmoon808,Aug-13 2019,You are amazing writer. This story was amazing. I reveled in ready it  it was such a wonderful story. Honestly  I wish I could write as beautifully as you do. Whatever you plan to do  do it. There are people who will support you.                                              
FINAL NOTE,queenlythefirst,Aug-13 2019,I remember  a year ago I think  one of my English teachers asked us to write an persuasive essay to convince people to get an app or product. I chose Wattpad  and more specifically  this story. It has most of my favourite things rolled into one  mythology  reincarnation  gods  magic (dark magic too)  medieval feudal society and an immersive storytelling that sucked me into the world. I don't remember ever getting it back  but I did get into the English Lit class which was apparently very selective  so there you go. So for all of this  two years of intrigue  plot twists and that damn slow burn  I can safely say  from the bottom of my heart  thank you so  so much.                                
FINAL NOTE,queenlythefirst,Aug-13 2019,if you write a book about any one of these characters (even Thanatos and Ambrosine)  I will read it. You captured this world so beautifully and the characters so fluently that every time I click open a new chapter I feel like I am the characters or standing right beside them in some corporal form. You have created a masterpiece that deserves to be hung  in the Louvre.                                                
FINAL NOTE,queenlythefirst,Aug-13 2019,reminds me of the Tyrells  the colour scheme  and the secret matriarchy were the men are all handsome idiots and the women were the masterminds

FINAL NOTE,luv_jap,Aug-13 2019,I don't think Celestina was as air headed as you portray her to be. To me she was a promiscuous and wanted woman that was scorned by the one she wanted most and she was so obsessed with getting him back for that  that she became blind sighted by the embarrassment and anger. I think the more angrier she got  the sloppier she got and that was her ultimate downfall                                               
FINAL NOTE,brittae_13,Aug-13 2019,This note was truly a chapter in itself. Thank you for writing this book and sharing your experiences and struggles with us.

I joined quite literally at the end but thank you so much for sharing this beauty with us.

FINAL NOTE,collaterals,Aug-13 2019,I LOVE YOU TOOOOOO. Never had I ever imagined this book would be such a major part of me when I started reading it. Your writing was what called up to me but now it's so much more than that. Your characters have depth  your plot is so twisted and complex and your descriptions always bring tears to my eyes. You made me feel absolute pain  ground shaking  world breaking despair. You really are a writer and Crown of Glass is nothing but a master piece. I'm so proud of all of this  the words you pulled together to make such amazingly beautiful chapters. I had yet to find such a book that can make me feel so lost and full within the same chapter. It speaks of hope and endless time. And I love it  every crevice of it. Thank you Ellis  thank you.
