You were very descriptive with some of the gods, and because of that the reader is able to get a picture of the world they are in and the personality of the gods. I'm getting a Greek god vibe, but it's possible you have different gods in mind. I tend to think the chapter was a little short and I was disappointed there was so little.

CROWN OF GLASS,cdsheridan,"Jul 12, 2017","Oooooo chilling. Prologues can sometimes be wearisome, but you've managed to create this awesome sense of foreboding. I love the descriptions of each of the gods, and the fact that you've put it in the present tense. My one callout would be the capitalization of ""Era"" in the last paragraph ‚Äî if it's not a proper noun in the rest of the story to come, I don't think it needs to be capitalized here. But aside from that, yesyesyes! Can't wait to read more!",Reply
CROWN OF GLASS,castiehl,"Jul 10, 2017"," #believerbc  Oh hell yeah. I can't wait for this. Already I am hooked! This is exactly the sort of thing I would want to read.  Good news, I haven't spotted any grammar/spelling mistakes so far.   Absolutely beautiful descriptions, wonderful vocabulary. It was so powerful and enchants readers right away. The repetition of ""how do you kill a god?"" Set an eerie dynamic too. Also, I like the banner at the top - did you make it?  Excellent start!",1 Reply
