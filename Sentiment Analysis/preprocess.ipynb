Being honest  I really like the lore you've established here (just ask my friends  I'm a sucker for mythology!) And from reading this  it really shows that you've put alot into this world and how all these gods  goddesses and Houses fit into it all. You also really used text alignment to your advantage and I think it really fit the tone you were trying to convey. However  I have to say while the writing itself was fine  the overall feel of this opening felt...clunky.   \"\"This is the story Queen who no longer feared death..of a King who helped her laugh again....\"\" (I'm paraphrasing here  please bear with me.)  It's alot of telling versus showing and then you have a huge shift in tone. Almost like you went from pitching the story to the readers to going to some scene where X character is hearing stories around a campfire. It's a pretty sharp contrast and it doesn't go very well together in my opinion. I think you'd really benefit from getting rid of \"\"This is the story of a queen\"\" bit and just leaving this prologue as the conversation between the unknown characters about the world and the gods and goddesses who inhabit it.  So overall  I'm not super sold on this prolouge as it is  but your lore is so detailed that I think I'm going to move on and see what happens next.

      "I like this chapter a lot more than I liked the prolouge. The overall tone of this chapter was way more consistent and read a lot more smoothly as a result. I really liked the eerie atmosphere you created with the blood ritual; it definitely felt taboo and creepy (and I say that in the best way possible!) And though I don't know the name of this character who was narrating  whoever she was  I think she was established very well. Her tone struck me as very petulant  wanting something she wasn't fit to have and insisting she was owed it  even after she had been denied because some things just can't happen.  I'm definitely getting the idea that she might become a villain in this story after this failed encounter with the shade and the denied wish.   That aside however  I do have a note regarding the writing of this chapter. At times \" your prose became a bit too purple (another way to say it got overly descriptive) and really took away from what this could've been.  I saw this most at the opening here:  \"\"The clock struck twelve\"  the planets shifted \" the stars exchanged...my blue eyes were hazy...\"\" Your word choice for this section was nicely varied and certainly descriptive\" \" but it was a lot of description in a really short amount of time. I think cutting some of it out would help focus on the chapter on the main event (the interaction with the shade) alot more and really throw the reader in head first.  For example: \"\"The clock struck twelve and I watched as wisps of coal black smoke curled around my hands as the knives slit my wrists. Blood splattered onto the mirror in front of me\" \" the candles began to dim as I counted back from thirteen....\"\"  I'd hope you'd have better word choice than I did in the above\"  but I hope my point comes across either way. We're getting right into the ritual then  rather than taking our time.  Also  last thing  at the end you have single sentences as full paragraphs \" \"\"This was not supposed to happen\"  I had to run \" the corridor was empty...\"\"\"                                \n",

      " #OnlyVoraciousReader  Wonderful!  Superb!  The ending hook was done nicely and will keep the readers hooked and waiting for the next chapter.  It's a very well-written chapter  with good characterization. You have perfected the trick of writing chapters by writing well-sized chapters as most of the wattpaders are usually scrolling on their phones.   They prefer short chapters of 1500-2000 words.   Keep it short and sweet.   Well written.   Your description was well done and it makes the reader feel like he is actually experiencing the story.   Usually  authors choke the readers with too much information  but you are writing perfectly and giving the info gradually.   Excellent opener  though. Very hooking. A well-written chapter  with good characterization  I did not spot any grammar mistakes  but in case I did not spot them  I would recommend using a grammar-checker like Grammarly to smooth out the wrinkles.   It is a good thing that you did not use a lot of A/N in the first chapter  it deters people off from the topic. You have used the Ch1 well  most people misuse the Ch1 or simply do not know how to use it well. they give too much or too less info in one stroke.   I liked the way you end the chapter  it leaves the reader hungry for more.  Thank You.  Regards  OnlyVoraciousReader                                     \n",

My only suggestion is to make a part in every chapter where you explain what should be explained.

      " #BelieverBC  Overall the chapter was  well written. However I did have some issues with it  and I'll explain the the best that I can. First  as a prologue  it feels more like a chapter one. A prologue should be shorter  so I would reconsider the titling of this piece. Second  you use a lot of suddenly  and thens in the narrative. The problem with using words like And then  or suddenly  is that it takes away from the immediacy of the scene. We are taken away from the story by thinking of the word suddenly \" so it becomes something that kind of weakens the narrative. In dialogue I can see it working. We say \"\"all of a sudden\"\" a lot\"  so keep that in mind too.   I also feel that there is too much about the main character and the shade. Like I feel that there's being too much thrown in a prologue. I really feel like if you want to worldbuild Endollon  you should focus on the Regnants in the following chapter and leave world building out of the prologue (if you decide to keep it as a prologue). Prologues should be teasers  and I feel that there is just too much info in this. I know I said that already  but it's something that I think could be worked on for this prologue.    Now what I liked a lot was the way you handled most of the descriptions. Nothing was lacking in meat  and the voice was pretty strong all the way through  so I compliment that and your ability to continue writing with precise lines. There was the line I loved the most and it was the dialogue with the shade. For some reason I felt the shade being raspy voiced  and when I read that it had a raspy voice  I wondered why I felt like that. I noticed that the shade needs more description of raspy stuff  but I feel like thatmight have been why since it's shadowy and almost ghost like.   Overall this is an enjoyable read  even if it was a little heavy on the detail for a prologue.                              \n",

And the talk of the future queen means basically that Edna is destined for greatness which is great because Edna is great. I love her character. She seems honest and strong. Plus  I'm interested in seeing how she develops.  On another note: I thought it was cool how you started the story off in New York. It was a nice addition especially since most books of this ilk (i.e. Three Dark Crowns  A Song of Ice and Fire  The Crown  etc.) start off in the high-fantasy world of who knows where.   Not that there's anything wrong with that  of course. It just adds to the whole feeling I'm getting from this book.   A nice cool breath of fresh air. A brilliant breath of fresh air.

There are very few authors that would think twice before putting a chapter out in public without getting everything confirmed first. I commend you on that!   I believe there were quite a number of questions that could easily just be placed in one or two dialogues rather than separating them because it not only takes up a lot of space but it makes the story quite draggy if there were too many dialogues.

We find out a lot about the character and it is hard to process it all and remember every little detail.

I really liked how  upon learning of her imminent death  she refused to stay at the hospital. Instead  she decided to die on her own terms. Although  I really hope that somehow she doesn't die because I really like her.  You did a great job ending this chapter. They left me as the reader with questions wondering who these people were  why they were there  and how they've gotten into her home.  Another thing I really liked about this chapter was the repetition of thing she could never do again. I think it really helps convey her emotions.

That being said  some parts seemed very confusing at parts. A lot of characters  complete with full names and descriptions were thrown at once. I had to scroll up to remember who was who a few times. It also seemed a bit jarring to have a character named Robin Williams  considering he was a big public figure.  There was also a few gramatical type issues that took away from the story. You referred to Robin as Robbins at one point \" which an s at the end usually is reserved for a last name. The phrasing of \"\"Vienna let go of the leash on her pet poodle\" \" running over to wrap her arms around me\"\" implies that the poodle wrapped it's arms around Edna. Terrifying.   But\"  I really did enjoy the characters and the use of repetition of the things she could never do again.                                          \n",

      " #BelieverBC   In the first chapter  I like the conversation she has with Dr. Williams  but it feels like there should be more of a transition from introduction of Edna to Robin Williams  who I can't help but imagine as Robin Williams lol. The scene between her and the doctor is a very good one  and makes me wonder more about the doctor. Something tells me he might have a bigger role  but who knows. The last part of the chapter I liked the best  to be honest. It seems to get right into the meat of the story and makes you wonder what is going on with Edna and how those mysterious men got into her house. Also find it funny that a 28 year old reluctant socialite won a Pulitzer. It is kind of reminiscent of Edith Wharton in some ways  since she won the Pulitzer in '21 for The Age of Innocence (my fav lol).

Anyways  I'm just...lol cos here she is...literally dying of heart failure and these people are bantering right in front of her. And I think it's pretty obvious that she's having problems with her health/heart with her gasping and struggling so she shouldn't be surprised that Eric knows about her condition. Okay now another theory. Eric may be a potential lover to Edna right? Haha. Or am I wrong. But anyways  the ending is appropriate with a cliffhanger cos now we know that Edna's condition is actually 'made' and the only reason it's still working despite the ventricle practically dangling in the open is because she's....connected to the Gods/is a God?

Also  the fact that she gives him ten minutes seemed strange to me. I would not give anyone that time. I also got confused on how she's so shocked to have the guy know it was her heart. If your heart hurt  you'd probably show it by curling in on your chest. To somebody that saw  It'd be like a 50/50 chance between heart and lungs.   I love the story so far  though.

      "I love the story and the plot  however  at the beginning \" in the chapter called \"\"history has its eyes on you\"\" - I felt that there were too many information being scattered all at once about the different races that has emerged. And about the family in general.   Fortunately\"  It's not that hard to grasp the basic content about the lord of the sky and mother earth - having six children  and their two children -Cosmo and Titania - eventually becoming the rulers when the fall.  But  maybe it would be a good idea to draw a family tree   including ones for the different houses and show how they are linked together- so that the readers could look back on it in order to get a clearer understanding of the characters and the story.  It would be so much easier to get a snapshot view of it- if we ever do need a reference.   Sorry for the super long comment. I hope that I made sense when I typed this all in.

      "@Tophie_Star  Wow  you really do know her quite well  I feel so glad!üòá Well  you are absolutely right. Edwina is her own person  and she's used to power because she's actually had nothing in the start and she built it up herself - let me clarify with a bit of backstory here?   When Asteria died  well  Elodie too had died. Edwina's father  Lucius was Lord of Dracnesse but he was sentenced to fifty years of imprisonment. Both her parents gone. At the same time  Aidon had his Trials. Which left just Edwina and very small baby  Amphitrite  whom she had no idea how to raise. Oh  and she had half a huge river to defend  along with the combined strength of the really pissed off Valmonts and the greedy Everlys who wanted her part of the Derwent. That was one of the most trying times of her life  and those ghosts never left her. At all.  That's the reason why she feels very  very personal about her family. It's because she's known what it feels to live without them  and she knows how much precious your loved ones can be. Cosmo knew that fully well  and it forced him to threaten her. Because more or less  yes  Edwina is her own person  and she hates it when someone tells her what to do. She lives on her terms. She's seen injustice for too long  especially with the females  always considered the weaker sex in their world. So she tries harder and harder to fight  and it's one of the biggest lost wars of her life when she finally agrees to marry Tristan. Because it bends her to three men's will - her father  Cosmo  and Tristan himself. Besides  as a wife  she'd now have to move from Dracnesse and stay in Tristan's Castle in Stormholt.   And that is the same place where her mother's killer resides too.                      \n",

Now  the marriage has to be done. Don't honestly see why she can't marry Tristan--they feel attracted to each other.   Ohh. I wanna read Tristan's reaction. Hope they don't bite their throats off on their wedding though.   Great chapter Ellis....                                              \n",

My first three chapters got so much crap the first time I tried my hand in this writing my own work  someone in a bookclub went as far as downright saying she does not like the chapter at all and kept inlining every single flaw. Of course I delete them because that type of negative energy I do not need. Then another set of people were like I should do this and that you know what I did? I took all those crappy opinions and wore them like a freaking armor  I took a few deep breaths and rant to a few good friends. I believed in my story and I just said f*ck it! Went back and improved my chapters that was up and continued to write and today that same crappy book is a multi time award winner! It started out being featured in top 20s  then I reedited and we started winning third places  went back and reedited and we moved to second place! And I believe so much in my story and felt it can do better  I started rewriting that shit. It's been a rough road to where we are now but the challenges made us where we are now. So my advice! Take deep breaths and rant out all your emotions  then go back to the drawing broad with a big f*ck it and WRITE if you believe in your characters WRITE!

Every time someone critiqued my works and saying that it's absolute rubbish  it would always get to my head.

      "Aw honey  I haven't read it yet  but I think your book seems awesome! It's great that you're trying to break cliches \" and the \"\"keeping the readers afraid of the mc\"\" part is not only a good way to hook your readers\"  it's actually different from other books! Only a few books keep you genuinely worried about the characters (ASOIAF)  but in most of them  you're sure they're gonna come out victorious.  I totally get that thing about being down because of a review. I got one for my story Up  Up and Away once and even though most of it was still in a positive light  the negative parts hit me HARD. They were things I had never stopped to consider. Although I was (and still am) thankful to the reviewer  I began to question why on earth I was even bothering to write in the first place. I began to think that I was the worst writer on the face of the planet  and I was writing the most cringeworthy book of all time. What I decided from that was to not ask for my book to be properly reviewed until after I completed it. That way  I wouldn't break down half-way through and sit in mourning for the death of my confidence. But after a while  most (not all  I guess) of the insecurity wore off  and I felt more confident about writing. And the encouragement of my friends really helped too. If your readers think your work is good  if they like it  then that does half the trick!   Although it's important to actually like what you write  I think it's also natural for you to question parts of your book. Being blind to your own flaws can't possibly be of any help  so it's a good thing if you know where you're going wrong! That way  you can improve. (And not become full of yourself by thinking you've written the best book in the whole wide world.)   As your friend  all my support is with you. I hope you will be able to see your book in good light again soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è                            \n",

      "This comment may be offensive. You know I love this book. It's wonderful it really is  the writing is well done and it's clear that you've thought the story out and have a direction that this is all going in but ; I don't think any of these scenes with the royalty have been properly thought out. Edwina is Queen regnant no matter if they like her or not  no matter if they want money or into her pants her word is law. The fact that these same people can continue to disrespect her  harass her and try to kill her MULTIPLE times WITHOUT punishment is completely unacceptable and amazing to me that NO ONE does anything about this! You could argue that she broke his hand or whatever just happened but that is not what the punishment should be for someone trying to kill THE QUEEN in her own home. These people should be locked away or tied to a rock so their insides can be pecked out by birds for eternity but they should not be given warning after warning without anything being done. Same with Tristan. The scene where he rescues the young girls is insane! A man should NOT be able to WHIP THE KING ACROSS THE FACE and continue breathing! By even disobeying direct orders from him should equal some kind of punishment if not death equal to death. I'm sorry if this seems rude but every time I read about these people calling their QUEEN wench or harlot or trying to kill her AGAIN it just takes me out of the story. I can't imagine that they just let these horrific people continue on with their wicked lives as if they had half as much power as Tristan and Edwina do. I don't know what kind of monarchy these people are running but it clearly isn't effective.                                             \n",

      "Hello there! Since you've expressed the desire of improving  so I've read this far and now I'm ready to give you a first opinion. You already know what I think of the introduction chapter  so I will focus more on the following two. The plot per se is very unique  so is the world you created and its system. I found the Monarch Trials interesting and the magic the gods wield certainly have potential. Having said that  I'm not sure I'm going to continue your story - here's why. The writing style had appropriate diction and proper grammar  however  I personally found it meagre  almost like a script  with plenty of well-constructed dialogue but no real narrative. Perhaps it was because of the need to explain a lot of stuff (I'lll come back to that)  but to me it felt fast and rushed. It caused  therefore  a lot of confusion in my head  specially with the character  which I wasn't able to identify. Expect for Edna  since it's her point of view  I have only blurry ideas of the other characters mentioned. They are reduced to their names  while I don't have an idea of how they look like  how they act  and what their personality is like. Your way of explaining background is clear and neat  however  I felt that it was definitely too much  to the point I personally don't have a real input to jump and read the next chapter. In many ways  it also felt obvious. I expected she was going to be a god  and that they'd put her on Earth for her protection. Again  the world you created and its players have tons of potential  which I envy  but they are not expressed to their fullest  thus  sounding to me both chaotic and simplistic. Last but not least  in terms of emotions  I personally didn't feel attached to Edna  in particular to her resistance to drink the medicine and come back to her real world. Mostly  it was because I didn't perceive the fifteen years she mentions  didn't feel the attachment she had to her life  despite the first chapter (which  if I may say  kind of (continues)             \n",

Otherwise it's great üëç üòä  The one part eating me alive was her heart condition. If it was as bad as the doctors said it was  she wouldn't be allowed to do any strenuous activity. So the prolonged scene in the second chapter where everyone is arguing and Edna has a gun is really stretching it. She would have had problems throughout the whole scene. When the first guy (blondie I believe  lol) appears out of nowhere  that would have given her an awful start.   Plus  holding a gun with the intent to shoot would skyrocket a heart rate. Not sure how much shooting experience you've had  but a gun is a very explosive weapon. A lot can go wrong  especially at such close range. Even if she's been trained to use it  that doesn't change the fight or flight response she would be having in the moment. The movies make it seem like nothing to fire away  but that's far from the reality.  ~ I really loved the opening line. I've done a script with that same first part spoken by Edna  and it really brought a lot back for me to read that. Probably not what you were going for  but I thought I'd share  cause it stuck with me through all 3 chapters. The rest of the dialogue was also quite good  might I say.

      "I have a theory!   You see  there were things that were going awfully wrong throughout the last few chapters  starting with when Edwina kissed Eric.   No..   It started when she first saw the Titaness. Ever since then  strange things have been happening. I think that it's because of their presence. Because the only person who knows that they're there is Edwina  so they have everyone turn against her.   Aidon is affected. In the previous chapters  we see how he is with Edwina; he loves her. This isn't how he'd act..   Her sister  Amphitrie  is affected. Llewellyn was affected. Eric. Basically everyone  with the exception of the Rotavelles  because they were always *sshats.   Aidon isn't the one who wants the Cube; the Titans do. It's a whole ploy  to get it and destroy all the gods/goddesses. And they started it  by turning them all on their Queen. They made her feel like an outcast  a murderer.  Plus  she's the only one of them who can figure out how to open the Cube. I refuse to believe that they're all acting like assholes  because she killed the triplets.   Everyone knows Edwina by now and her love for Amphitrite  so they could've easily put down that bullsh*t.

      "God. I'm so sad to see this book over honestly. For months I had been going through some stuff and finally decided to get Wattpad again. I'll never forget the day I was looking through the tags Fantasy and found this piece of treasure. I put it in my library  just knowing I had to keep it there and read it. The moment I started to read it  I was completely hooked. Throughout the chapters you made me laugh  cry  (well almost. I was out in public so held back during most chapters) and made me want to write something like this. But unfortunately  as you know I quit writing. But you made me realize how much I miss and loved writing. Also  at the end of all the chapters I remembered that life doesn't all give us a happy ending.   When I say it's hard for me to read sometimes  it definitely is. Sometimes if I'm not interested enough my mind wanders  and I don't really focus on the story. But this  of course I did. From start to finish   . So I want to thank you. Thank you so much for creating this beautiful work of Art. Thank you for giving me inspiration when I least expected it  and thank you for giving me hope and strength when it was most needed. Edwina taught me a lot  but if anything she taught me to be strong and fight  because a Queen NEVER goes down without a fight.                                     \n",

I mean I've seen how fucking tall he is... but he was a sweet  hot guy! How could he be one of humanity's destroyers?!  Buts that's just my thoughts.

The pain that I felt when Tristan died was shocking. The silent sobbing was shocking. The sheer force of your words nearly bowled me over. Hours and hours  I have spent pouring over your work. You point out the flaws  but I want to bring to light the beautiful strengths that it has. The words themselves work alongside you. The imagery is stronger than a Robert Frost poem.

Your characters have depth  your plot is so twisted and complex and your descriptions always bring tears to my eyes. You made me feel absolute pain  ground shaking  world breaking despair. You really are a writer and Crown of Glass is nothing but a master piece. I'm so proud of all of this  the words you pulled together to make such amazingly beautiful chapters. I had yet to find such a book that can make me feel so lost and full within the same chapter. It speaks of hope and endless time. And I love it  every crevice of it.
